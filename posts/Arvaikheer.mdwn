We towed the Peugeot 306 to the drop off point in Bayanhongor and said goodbye
to the Icelanders.  They were going to catch a bus and meet us in UB
(Ulaanbaatar).

 Altai to Bayanhongor definitely seemed like the hardest stretch and we saw
5 or 6 cars at the drop off point that also didn't finish.  We ate our last packet of Nong Shim Ramen
from the 20 pack box I bought back in New Malden and we got underway by 2pm. I
was quite worried we might be pushing our luck as we had been told that it would take 4-5hrs to get to
Arvaikheer. Thankfully the weather was fine, most of the snow
seemed to disappear and we made it in 4.5hrs. This was our last piece of dirt
road, since we knew the next leg was all sealed. How I am going to miss those
[Mongolian roads](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6129220415/), they were
really good fun. Intense concentration was required.

So we arrived in Arvaikheer with an hour of sunlight left, so we thought we had
plenty of time to evaluate its hotels. The first one was a building site
outside, but was warm and an OK standard, but a bit dear at ~40USD. The next
place didn't have its heating on and it had a policemen's party on the floor
below. You could clearly hear the excruciating Karaoke from below. The next
places were shitholes and we were directed by a Mongolian guide to a couple of
other hotels, but we frustratingly couldn't find them. After an hour I thought
we should go for the very first hotel, only to find the room was now
unavailable.  Tired, cold, hungry and frustrated. Not a good combination. So we
settled on the place with the Karaoke and we told it would finish by 11pm.
Which it did actually, thankfully.

Next we tried to find food and we did find a place with a waitress who was about
16 but amazingly could speak English. We ate dinner and breakfast there.
Breakfast is a nerve racking affair in Mongolia. I am in wonder how they will
screw up the eggs. Broken? Stone cold? Anything is possible.

I almost forgot to mention we went next door to a night club called "New
Leader" in Arvaikheer. It was cold, the sound system sounded like the speakers
were all blown. The music was a bit hardcore and there tables of mostly hard
looking men ordering a beer for each and a large bottle of vodka for the table. No doubt
people were going to get seriously drunk!

Anyway Arvaikheer was our last night on the road and I was miserable, I hope
you can tell by reading this. ;)
