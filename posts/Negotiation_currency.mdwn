Since [Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/groups/301264206907?ap=1) are a
bit of a black hole when it comes to information, I thought I'd copy & paste
some useful tidbits.

Still I think leaving a policeman with your disposable drivers license and then
driving away sounds like a recipe for disaster.

From observing hard negotiating Israelis in India, I think good negotiation is
about **persistence**. I plan to brush up on my weak Russian (& learn Farsi?),
stay positive, polite and friendly and let the fun begin.
