Since [Facebook groups](http://www.facebook.com/groups/301264206907?ap=1) are a
bit of a black hole when it comes to information, I thought I'd copy & paste
some useful tidbits.

From Warrick:

	£1 GBP =

	1.60 $ USD
	1.14 EURO
	28 Czech Koruna
	4.85 Romanian New Leu
	116 Serbian Dinar
	2.23 Bulgarian Lev
	2.66 Turkish Lira
	17000 Iranian Rial
	4.57 Turkmenistani Manat
	2778 Uzbekistani Som
	234 Kazakhstani Tenge
	72 Kyrgyzstani Som
	45 Russian Ruble
	1978 Mongolian Tughrik
	10.38 Chinese Yuan Renminbi

And James on the merits of the [IDP](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5869205510).

	A lot of negotiating later, and blunt refusal by the corrupt bastard, we got it
	back for $200. ALWAYS show the International Driving License, and buy two of
	them. They're basically disposable

Still I think leaving a policeman with your disposable drivers license and then
driving away sounds like a recipe for disaster.

From observing hard negotiating Israelis in India, I think good negotiation is
about **persistence**. I plan to brush up on my weak Russian (& learn Farsi?),
stay positive, polite and friendly and let the fun begin.
