[Jamie](https://jamiek.it/) and [I](https://hendry.iki.fi/) are planning our
[[route]] with urgency, thanks to the [Visa
machine](https://visamachine.theadventurists.com) deadline of last Sunday.

However we can't figure out if the Russia / Azerbaijan border crossing is possible.

Yay

* A friend in Georgia, says her Azeri friend says it's open
* I called the [Azeri embassy in London](https://www.azembassy.org.uk), he says it's open

Nay

* [Visa machine](https://visamachine.theadventurists.com/index.php?mode=visamachine&setadv=90) says The section of the Russian border between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea is closed.
* [Wikitravel says it's only open to CIS nationals](https://wikitravel.org/en/Caucasus#Border_Crossing)
