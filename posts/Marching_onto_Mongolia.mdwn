Following on from the previous [[Russia to Azerbaijan]] post, [Rob
Mills](https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=301264206907&topic=37245) explains
that the Azerbaijan border isn't the problem, it's the Russians who don't let
non-CIS (ex-soviet) citizens through. I have written to the Russian Embassy in
London and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/40774134132641792),
and they have yet to reply. Drat.

Oh well, that saves on the costly double entry visa for Russia and one for
Azerbaijan.

In other news, Jamie and I have convinced his parents that we will keep the car
in Steyning, West Sussex once we've bought it. We have been looking for 1L cars
on [Autotrader](https://www.autotrader.co.uk) and there aren't that many
choices. I'm keen on a Polo or a Toyota Yaris, though there doesn't seem to be
a lot of choice, especially when you only consider Private Ads and <10 years
[Mongol Rally car
rule](https://mongolrally.theadventurists.com/index.php?mode=handbook&handbook=mongolrallypublic&page=publicvehiclerules).
Our budget is 1500GBP btw.

I am quite excited to have met a person from Kyrgyzstan who is doing a English
class in the building I live in near Edgware Road. I also heard that Turkmen
school here, so I am trying to work out a way of announcing my "mission" to a
class of English learners. I am hoping to get hosted / guided whilst we pass
through these exotic stans.

We've setup a charity [donation](https://www.justgiving.com/geekout) page that
should make it easy for you all to donate money, not to us, though to
[Mongolian kids who have had it rough](https://www.cncf.org). Our target is
1000GBP, please give something.  Anything. Crikey. I am not going to spend it!

* Looking into cameras to mount on the dash. Considering the [Gopro](https://gopro.com/cameras/hd-motorsports-hero-camera)
* Looking for a good Android tool to post updates on our route to Facebook et al, so you all can keep upto date of our progress. Think average speeds and other geeky statistics. Want.

* A Ukrainian friend asked me whether I'm going to drop by [Kazantip](https://kazantip.com), that looks a bit too crazy
