Quick update from the [Hotel Grand
Derya](http://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6021067536) in [Dogbiscuit,
Turkey](http://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/100221396923322368).

We've done over 4k miles now! We covered some distance from Istanbul, Cappadocia, all
the way here to this Iranian border town.

Cappadocia, although a tourist trap, was actually pretty good. Through the power
of my [twitter
network](http://twitter.com/#!/TurkeyTourismUK/status/99108049226186755), we
probably had the best hotel in Cappadocia at a good price. It had a pool, the
host Hassan arranged a balloon flight the next morning. Fantastic stuff.

First the massive [underground city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaymakl%C4%B1_Underground_City) and then the [Göreme Open Air Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_of_G%C3%B6reme,_Turkey) - Jamie], we drove till dusk
and "wild camped" in a nice spot. The Turkish countryside has been stunning.


Today we are quickly going to check out [Ishak Pasha
Palace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishak_Pasha_Palace) and then try the
Iranian border. Hopefully we'll be over by lunch and then get a 4-5hr drive to
Tabriz to check out another [UNESCO site](http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1346)
on the way to Tehran.

Our "Interneting", i.e. our internet connectivity, twitter updates, blogs and
video uploads might come to a crashing halt. However we do have a SPOT messenger,
[with map
updates](http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0E4XTjiADylnLZeEL5e24gU0yUzxckg9Q)
however it is limited to only 41 characters. So if you wondering why [my
tweets](http://twitter.com/kaihendry) are so short in Iran. That's why.
