Jamie and I aren't intrepid buddies from 6th form in a gap year!

No, no we are seasoned travellers. Jamie has been [several
places](https://map.kitten-x.com/) and so have I on [the world
map](https://maps.natalian.org/).

We express cultural sensitivies and this is why instead of robbing and
pillaging people along our [[route]] to Mongolia, we are [raising
money](https://www.justgiving.com/geekout) for those [poor
people](https://www.flickr.com/photos/razorbern/sets/72157624626516580/with/4923602887/).

Furthermore did you know we are donating our car once we arrive? Mongolians
will have less need to cruelly sadle up an animal and parade on its back.

How are you saving the world?
