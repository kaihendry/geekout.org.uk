My friends and work colleagues are proving to be difficult patrons of poor
children. I have since setup a system to punish my colleagues, else God will.

	Hello all,

	Please come to Suite 502 and break the rules of the quiet room. The fine
	is 1GBP and the money will all go to https://www.cncf.org Not me, not my
	car, not alcohol, not entertaining women, instead it will ALL go to
	foreign children.

	I am aiming to raise at least 500GBP for the charity CNCF as part of my
	effort to bring peace to this troubled area.

	Thank you in advance,

Remember you don't have to just give, you can also make a
[[bet|non-sponsorship]] on a child's life.
