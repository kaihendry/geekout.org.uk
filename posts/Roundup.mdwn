Jamie and I have been very busy getting the little bits and pieces together for
the Mongol Rally.

Before I start, may I invite you to the [Festival of
Slow](https://mongolrally10.theadventurists.com/index.php?page=festival-of-slow-overview)
at [Goodwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwood_Circuit) on Saturday the 23
of July to see us off? It would be great if you could make it. :)

* Jamie's sister's boyfriend Josh (who is a [Farrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrier) by trade) has made our Micra an awesome [steel sump guard](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/5938270040/)
* Found some [Mongol Rally
statistics](https://www.theadventurists.com/the-jibber/mongol-rally-in-numbers)
with [Rob](https://twitter.com/#!/RobAdventurists) adding: 300 teams and a little over 200 will make it to [UB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulan_Bator) with car
* I'm accredited with a first aid course from [Steve Blethyn](https://www.steveblethyn.co.uk/), so I should be able to keep Jamie alive for a few more minutes
* I'm still [waiting for my Iranian visa](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5900930968/), as well as Tajikistan & Turkmenistan invite
* Jamie has [[got his new passport|Not_the_Best_Day_of_My_Life]] and is also stressing out with the last few visas
* Complained about the [FCO](https://www.fco.gov.uk/en/) Website and yes, I've accepted the potential risks
* Practiced putting up our [tent](https://www.vango.co.uk/tents/atlas-300.html) (& Jamie took it down)
* Bought some [Korean noodles and supplies](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5872491113) with the help of Sean and his [fogging machine business](https://www.brown-y.co.uk)
* Ordered some collectible **Team Geek out** calling cards and stickers from <https://uk.moo.com>
* Obtained an [International Drivers Permit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5869205510) - Trivia: I've actually had one before when I first drove in the UK from South Africa
* Moving the bulk of my possessions out of W2 1DS this Thursday, to storage at [Praze Farm](https://prazefarm.co.uk)
* Doing "hand over" for my [work](https://hendry.iki.fi/cv/), [Marcos](https://datadriven.com.au/) will be replacing me. Also about to push out a [Webconverger release](https://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Webconverger_8.5_release_notes/)
* Bought a [Central Asia map](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5897686017/) from [Stanfords](https://www.stanfords.co.uk/) and I've figured out most of the closest / interesting UNESCO sites on the [[route]]!
* We are 50GBP shy of our 1000GBP charity fund raising target! Donate now or during the trip at <https://www.justgiving.com/teams/geekout/>


Have we missed anything? I am so ridiculously excited.
