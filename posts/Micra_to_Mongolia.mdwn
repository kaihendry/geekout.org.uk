All we need now is the car! We are looking to purchase a [2002/2003 Nissan
Micra
Tempest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Micra#Micra_K11C_.281997.E2.80.932003.29)
by the end of the month.

>The K10/K11 generations of Micra were known for reliability, excellent build quality, and user friendliness.

>In What Car's Reliability Supertest in 2007, Nissan was ranked 6th out of 26 manufacturers overall, with the K11 Micra (1998–2002) being its most reliable model.

We got it on the 22nd of May! ~10 days until the deadline...
