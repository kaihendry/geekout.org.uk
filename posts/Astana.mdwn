The drive to Astana was very long but fairly uneventful. If you have a look at
[the map](http://geekout.org.uk/map/) you can see we drove around a very large lake in the south of the
country, which was an absolutely [beautiful perfect turquoise colour](http://maps.google.com/?ll=45.759859,76.168213&spn=4.522295,9.854736&t=h&z=7&vpsrc=6), not unlike
the Kazakh flag, maybe that's where it comes from.

Darkness fell between 7 and 8 when we still had a considerable distance to go.
By that point we'd driven for about 12 hours and covered about 3/4 of the
1100km (passing our 10,000th mile on the way). Passing through Karagandy there
were a couple of signed detours along surprisingly bad roads, considering that
we were travelling from Kazakhstan's biggest city to its capital. At one point
I was following a couple of cars along a flyover when they drove around a small
road block. I followed, not thinking much of it. Then we came to another road
block and both cars turned off the road. I followed. The road got smaller and
smaller until it was barely a dusty track. We crossed several railway tracks.
Kai started to freak out. Just as I was beginning to wonder if we should turn
around we found tarmac again, and eventually met the main road again.

Incredible. Relief.

Reaching Astana at midnight we managed to find a hotel very quickly, and went
straight to bed. We'd been driving for 16 hours.

The stories of Astana we'd heard in Almaty led me to imagine something along
the lines of Ashgabat, lots of new but empty and useless/already fading
buildings. But actually it was pretty normal as things go. Kai and I went to
see the Norman Foster "tent" this morning. It looked disappointedly small from
the outside, but it does manage to contain a six story shopping mall. As a
measure of how bright it is here, I took a picture *inside* the shopping mall
at ISO 100.

We're now rushin' to Russia. We'll probably camp tonight, hopefully inside
Russia, and make Novosibirsk tomorrow.
