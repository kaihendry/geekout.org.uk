Bulgaria was surprisingly OK. For me it's a strange mix of Russian (they
understand it, unlike the Romanians seemingly) and France (cute rustic
buildings and amazing countryside). Food is pretty bad and I'm totally
unconvinced on Bulgarian's sense of taste and style.

Varna and resorts to the south seemed popular for the English tourists and to
be honest the prices and women are quite attractive. Ahem.

So we quickly did the UNESCO tourist trap of Nessebar and headed into Turkey.
Border crossing was great... friendly staff and an initial hiccup with their
[computer failing](https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/98788319923666944).
What a super drive. The scenery was stunning and dropping into Turkey was like
entering another world. Fantastic scenery.  Awesome sunset. Incredible.

Turkish roads and infrastructure seem amazingly good. We were a little worried
we forgot the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignette_(road_tax)">Vignette</a>, though we
picked up a KSG Auto-bahn card at a petrol station. We were easily averaging
100km/h and we made it into Istanbul with the help of Google maps... without
incident. Nuts. [Good driving, huh? - Jamie]

The 50EUR per night twin room hostel in Istanbul's Sultanahmet is a bit poor
value for money to say the least.  There seems to be a chasm between "hostel"
and "hotel" and it's really hard to bridge it. I am not interested really in
talking with tourists from UK and the West [unless they're good looking]. I'm
more keen to chat with locals.  A decent wifi Internet connection would be nice
too!

Today the weather is pretty hot, though I've got the Blue Mosque, the
[bath](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6007851939/) and the Sofia Mosque
out the way and I'm feeling pretty weak and dazed. There is a lot of history
here which makes me feel a little depressed tbh. Life is incredibly short in
the scheme of things and I worry a bit how I fit in...

Frustratingly Google Maps does not work (very strange) and we don't have a map
of Iran*. Can't help but feel our lack of planning ahead is catching up with us.
And finding information with a shit internet connection in Istanbul is crazy
hard compared to London.

Must thank Ruth who I contacted to help find some accommodation in Turkey for
us. I did another [shout
out](https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/99104332758265857) for help
tomorrow, wonder if anyone gets it (Folks did!!
[Thank](https://twitter.com/#!/TurkeyTourismUK/status/99108049226186755)
[you](https://twitter.com/#!/ED8617/status/99145705771376640) ). I guess we
should just chance it, but it could easily cost us a lot of time. I'm keen to
spend 2-3 days in Tehran.

I've had the epiphany that Istanbul is well... the centre of the world. They
way it bridges continents and the understated Black and Aegean sea. It's just
insanely strategic. I want Turkey in the EU. :)

\* Jamie: After going to multiple bookshops and drawing a complete blank on
Iranian maps I was advised by a tourist agency to try the Iranian Consulate. I
pictured an office block, but arriving I found a gated community. Nervous I
asked the Turkish policeman on guard whether it was alright to bother them, he
said yes and upon entering I found a small man, who understood enough English
to give me a map of attractions. It doesn't have any roads on it but it's
better than nothing.
