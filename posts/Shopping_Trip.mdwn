So I spent much of Saturday looking for bits and pieces for the car, and
<a href="https://geekout.org.uk/kit/">anything else</a> that could be generally useful. I started by
looking for breaker's yards in the Yellow Pages, hoping for a bit of a
Scrapheap Challenge job: looking around, finding a Micra in surprisingly good
condition stacked on top of two other cars, clambering up and ripping the thing
apart with an angle grinder. Back in the real world the only place I could find
with any Micra spares was Hove Car Spares. They said they could sell me a
suspension unit complete with wheel hub for Â£30 and could find me a second
spare wheel. I went and picked up the unit, but unfortunately no wheel, they
said they'd have them in this week. They also gave me some handy tips about
what might be useful and sold me an ignition coil and recommended some liquid
metal and a new fan belt. I was also told that the drive shafts on Micra's were
weak, eek.

We'll probably take the hub off before we go, it's quite heavy and would only
fit one side.

On the way back to Steyning is a B&Q and Halford's in the same lot. I stopped,
felt depressed by the superstore anonymity of it all and left. In Steyning is a
lovely little shop called Steyning Motor Spares run by Pete. I stopped off and
spent probably the better part of an hour wandering around finding useful
stuff, pictured above. I left him a list of things to see if he could get
including a pump and a cheap tool set.

Back at my mum's I found my sister Maddy and her boyfriend Josh, who is a bit
of a mechanic. Showing him around the car getting tips and advice we reached
the engine, he was pointing things out to me, tapping this and that, when there
was a crunch and a "Whoops", he'd put his finger through the coolant reservoir.
Which I was able to quickly repair using my newly acquired duct tape. 

While at Mum's I checked out the tent situation. Not good. Both tents had many
broken poles, which makes dome tents difficult, to say the least. It seems like
we might as well buy a new cheapo one, that will at least be quick to put up.

In other news Kai and I have been "discussing" <a
href="https://www.theadventurists.com/">the new Adventurists website</a>. For
the record I like the new site, it's nice and bright, it looks good, it's easy
to get around and I completely understand why they have chosen to compile the
handbook into a PDF.
