<p>The drive to Astana was very long but fairly uneventful. If you have a look at
<a href="https://geekout.org.uk/map/">the map</a> you can see we drove around a very large lake in the south of the
country, which was an absolutely <a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=45.759859,76.168213&amp;spn=4.522295,9.854736&amp;t=h&amp;z=7&amp;vpsrc=6">beautiful perfect turquoise colour</a>, not unlike
the Kazakh flag, maybe that's where it comes from.</p>

<p>Darkness fell between 7 and 8 when we still had a considerable distance to go.
By that point we'd driven for about 12 hours and covered about 3/4 of the
1100km (passing our 10,000th mile on the way). Passing through Karagandy there
were a couple of signed detours along surprisingly bad roads, considering that
we were travelling from Kazakhstan's biggest city to its capital. At one point
I was following a couple of cars along a flyover when they drove around a small
road block. I followed, not thinking much of it. Then we came to another road
block and both cars turned off the road. I followed. The road got smaller and
smaller until it was barely a dusty track. We crossed several railway tracks.
Kai started to freak out. Just as I was beginning to wonder if we should turn
around we found tarmac again, and eventually met the main road again.</p>

<p>Incredible. Relief.</p>

<p>Reaching Astana at midnight we managed to find a hotel very quickly, and went
straight to bed. We'd been driving for 16 hours.</p>

<p>The stories of Astana we'd heard in Almaty led me to imagine something along
the lines of Ashgabat, lots of new but empty and useless/already fading
buildings. But actually it was pretty normal as things go. Kai and I went to
see the Norman Foster "tent" this morning. It looked disappointedly small from
the outside, but it does manage to contain a six story shopping mall. As a
measure of how bright it is here, I took a picture <em>inside</em> the shopping mall
at ISO 100.</p>

<p>We're now rushin' to Russia. We'll probably camp tonight, hopefully inside
Russia, and make Novosibirsk tomorrow.</p>
