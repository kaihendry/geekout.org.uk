	<description>&lt;p&gt;max 70 days out over the whole year? or max 70 days out over the whole trip?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have annual insurance with 40-day-per-trip, unlimited-number-of-trips that worked out well for me as I travel a lot. I think in part the pricing is based on the fact that people buying it are going to be having a couple of weeks of holidays a year (eg 20 days of travel), whilst if you&#39;re buying a specific number of days, you&#39;re going to be out of the country probably for that specific number of days. By buying the annual insurance, you get to spread more of your risk onto others who don&#39;t travel so much.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>I assume max 70 days per year. My trip is likely to be 50 days, so 40 isn&#39;t much help. My point really was that the 45 and 62 day single trip options from Campbell Irvine seem like a bit of a rip off.
