<p>We set off for the Altai Mountains from Novosibirsk by keeping to the rather good M52 road. We
knew we were in the Altai when we started seeing these quite beautiful
mountains and accompanying rivers. There were many guest houses and some camp
spots on the way, though none seemed suitable to us. Too close to a house. Too
close to a road.</p>

<p>As dusk fell we found ourselves in a very wet misty area of the Altai where the
road struck off from the main river. After some abortive searching we found a suitable
place, though the road was too muddy to take our Micra to our camp site. We
ended up parking the car by the road and carrying our stuff to the sodden camping
ground near a worryingly high stream. We setup just before a downpour. In the rain we cooked
Ramen and we ate it in the tent. Thunder and lightning made it a bit of a
dreary/exciting night, nonetheless I am kind of glad to have the experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6108106092/" title="Breakfast Picnic and Drying by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6086/6108106092_26c180ebf6.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="Breakfast Picnic and Drying"></a></p>

<p>The next day we were back on the M52 heading for Tashanta. After a couple of hours the damp mist lifted and a
warming sun came out. We stopped and  made eggs with
smoked wieners on the bank of a scenic [apart from all the rubish :(] river where we found out that we had been
featured in an online Nsk newspaper, being the most popular article (15,000 hits!) and even acquired a female fan! 
We laid out all our wet camping gear, which dried very quickly in the morning sun. The news, the drying and the 
breakfast all lifted our previously damp [haha] spirits and we hit the road, very keen to get into Mongolia.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprisingly the landscape very quickly changed from green mountainsides to light
brown sandy slopes. It looked like Mongolia all of a sudden. Usual border
crossing shenanigans entailed, including our first really thorough search upon leaving Russia,
though I felt like a veteran at this stage and I was almost sad that it was our last one!</p>

<p>It was off that the Russian immigration officer wanted 100 rubles in some
registration fee. What cheek. It was worse on the Mongolian side. A 5USD
disinfectant fee? Passport control offering to change money? Various fees from
7 to 10 dollars for god knows what. Anyhoo, we got through.</p>

<p>There was a list of all the Mongol ralliers and it was interesting to see that
yes, indeed, we were one of the very last to cross.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6108116726/" title="Mongolia by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6205/6108116726_f3e64dd9c3.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="Mongolia"></a></p>

<p>We met 2 Norwegians in a fire truck which was good. Then on the road we met the
four motorcyclists/mopedists we'd met in Turkey, who'd already stopped to camp. They were in good spirits and I must say
they must have had quite a strenuous rally! From the insurance office on the border
we'd picked up a female hitch hiker, who later sang in our car, which provided
us some entertainment on the way to Olgii.</p>

<p>We were keen to get to Olgii as Team America had been in touch with us, they
must have realised we were only a day behind and were looking for someone to
travel with to UB. We were too tbh, so I was glad to see their invite. We are
about to breakfast with them and they are keen to go off the beaten track and
take the more challenging "Northern route". As opposed to the "Southern route" which the
Mongol Rally handbook seems to only mention. Tbh I am keen to do the track
other ralliers do, but then again I am brimming with confidence.</p>

<p>As the handbook says, fast speeds and big rocks end badly. It also mentions if
everything goes well, you should make UB in 5 days. Jamie now has 6.5 days until his
flight, so this going to be tight.</p>
