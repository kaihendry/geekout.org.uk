<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6177495903/" title="IMG_0460 by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6151/6177495903_0823d39205.jpg" width="374" height="500" alt="IMG_0460" align="left"></a></p>

<p>About 40 years ago, 300 odd kilometers north of Ashgabat in Turkmenistan some
noxtious gases were seeping out of the ground at a drilling site. It was
decided to burn off the gases and so they were lit. The ground collapsed, the
rig fell into the hole, and the fire has been burning ever since. It's quite a
sight, and tourists have been going to have a look ever since. Now apparently
the Turkmen authorities don't like tourists, and I imagine the whole episode
was a bit of an embarrassment, so they took the logical step and raised the
local village, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derweze">Darvaza</a>, to the ground
(leaving the bread oven standing due to religious reverance) to desaude
visitors. It is against this backdrop that Kai and I left Ashgabat yesterday
afternoon and headed north.</p>

<p>Driving 300km through desert is a thirsty business and by the time we got to
what I assume had once been Darvaza, complete with lone bread oven and a handy
wall to hide the car behind, we'd already drunk about half of the water we had
with us. We also hadn't seen a petrol station since just outside Ashgabat.</p>

<p>Just before Darvaza, suspiciously close infact, had been a police check point.
This panicked us a bit, hence the hiding of the car, and we decided to wait
until dark and then walk the last three miles through the desert to the "hell
mouth".  Not quite as crazy as it sounds as Kai had already put the coordinates
into his GPS device.</p>

<p>Walking through the desert was a little spooky. Kai claims he saw a snake, but
it could have just been a moving stick <img src="../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";)" /> Gradually in the distance we started
to see a slight glow on the horizon, and after climbing yet anouther ridge we
saw...  the moon. But all was not lost, there was definitely something else
glowing out there. After a total of about an hour and a half we did eventually
reach the great fire pit. It was nice, very peaceful and we scaled an
overlooking hill and sat for a while.</p>

<p>While it was nice to see, and walking through the desert was an experience, I'm
not sure I'd recommend it, or at least not the way that we did it. There is
apparently a track that leads to it if you can find it, or you can try to find
a guide, and you can camp nearby. As we returned and were getting close to the
car we heard a motorbike behind us, which by the time we got to the car had
caught up with is, and at just the same, as if on schedule, two other
motorbikes drew up, from opposite directions. The riders seemed to want to take
us on a tour of the flame pit. We tried to explain that we'd already been. They
stayed and chatted and gave us some chewing tobbacco, which was a bit strong,
and asked for gifts. Luckily we had some cigarettes and a pen and they left
eventually.</p>
