<p>Jamie and I with my girlfriend <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rufiec">Ruth</a> have met
Paul Van Est from <a href="https://www.teamgonewalkabout.com/">Team Walkabout</a>.</p>

<p>We exchanged news of our preparations and I'm shocked to hear that there might
not be any hotels along the way to Mongolia, which means we need to <strong>camp</strong>.</p>

<p>There goes my plan of wearing pressed shirts throughout the trip and enjoying
myself.</p>

<p>We chatted about what we could possibly give the locals besides diseases.
Should we tell them about our lives back home in Western civilisation? Should
we lie to them? Should we spread the message of hope, that we are coming for
their oil in exchange for democracy?</p>

<p>Perhaps the people of the East will surprise us Westerners. Maybe they possess
technologies we don't know about.</p>

<p>So I spent much of Saturday looking for bits and pieces for the car, and
<a href="https://geekout.org.uk/kit/">anything else</a> that could be generally useful. I started by
looking for breaker's yards in the Yellow Pages, hoping for a bit of a
Scrapheap Challenge job: looking around, finding a Micra in surprisingly good
condition stacked on top of two other cars, clambering up and ripping the thing
apart with an angle grinder. Back in the real world the only place I could find
with any Micra spares was Hove Car Spares. They said they could sell me a
suspension unit complete with wheel hub for Â£30 and could find me a second
spare wheel. I went and picked up the unit, but unfortunately no wheel, they
said they'd have them in this week. They also gave me some handy tips about
what might be useful and sold me an ignition coil and recommended some liquid
metal and a new fan belt. I was also told that the drive shafts on Micra's were
weak, eek.</p>

</center></p>

<p>We'll probably take the hub off before we go, it's quite heavy and would only
fit one side.</p>

<p>On the way back to Steyning is a B&amp;Q and Halford's in the same lot. I stopped,
felt depressed by the superstore anonymity of it all and left. In Steyning is a
lovely little shop called Steyning Motor Spares run by Pete. I stopped off and
spent probably the better part of an hour wandering around finding useful
stuff, pictured above. I left him a list of things to see if he could get
including a pump and a cheap tool set.</p>

<p>Back at my mum's I found my sister Maddy and her boyfriend Josh, who is a bit
of a mechanic. Showing him around the car getting tips and advice we reached
the engine, he was pointing things out to me, tapping this and that, when there
was a crunch and a "Whoops", he'd put his finger through the coolant reservoir.
Which I was able to quickly repair using my newly acquired duct tape. </p>

<p>While at Mum's I checked out the tent situation. Not good. Both tents had many
broken poles, which makes dome tents difficult, to say the least. It seems like
we might as well buy a new cheapo one, that will at least be quick to put up.</p>

<p>In other news Kai and I have been "discussing" <a
href="https://www.theadventurists.com/">the new Adventurists website</a>. For
the record I like the new site, it's nice and bright, it looks good, it's easy
to get around and I completely understand why they have chosen to compile the
handbook into a PDF.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>We've been getting lots of (well, two) scary emails from the Adventurists regarding all the official, bureaucratic stuff that we need to get done before the start of the Rally, exactly 29 days away now, especially the Carnet de Passage. The Carnet is basically a passport for the car, which we need in order to get through Iran, and to be able to leave the Micra in Mongolia. I sent the form off a couple of days ago along with a colour copy of the details pages of my passport and the V5. Yesterday I realised that I had not ticketed one of the boxes, and after all the dire warnings from the Adventurists and the RAC (for example, if the colour of the upholstery changes, or the make of the radio, you have to get a new Carnet) and the cost of the damn thing I rang the RAC in a panic expecting some boring official to tell me in a nasal voice that I would have to do the whole thing again. But no, to my surprise a very nice, helpful and relaxed guy answered and told me they'd received my application that morning and not to worry, everything was fine.</p>

<p>In other news the Iranian embassy cancelled my first visa appointment. We have used the Adventurists' visa service (the "Visa Machine") to get our visas, which seems to be going well, despite initial hiccups with the website (it kept forgetting our dates) and confusion over what we actually had to do (I assumed, wrongly, that they would even fill in the forms for us, it didn't seem that clear what we had to do once we'd finished the website bit). My rearranged appointment is now on Wednesday, which will apparently be quicker than the more popular Sunday at 9am slot, which I didn't fancy much anyway. I think the reason we need to be there is to get our finger prints taken, something the Adventurists really couldn't have done for us.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Yesterday was not the best day of my life. My Iranian visa appointment (to pay and have finger prints taken, it's already been approved) was supposed to be last week, but was cancelled. There was another opportunity to go last Sunday at 9am, but I decided that during the week would probably be quieter and less hangover-y. I doubt they're that keen on hangovers in the Iranian Consulate. So I went yesterday at midday. Three other ralliers were there, and a representative from the Adventurists. We waited patiently. And waited, and waited and waited. It was hot, at least as hot as Iran. The Adventurist always seemed to be next in line, but never quite got to the front of the queue. After a couple of hours one of our number got seen, and was dealt with in about ten minutes and left. The rest of us waited some more. A child screamed on and off. At about 3:00 two woman arrived, loudly saying they had appointments for 3 o'clock. At about 3:30 a very arsey English guy arrived, waving his number in the air and asking if everyone else had a number too. At about 4:00 our rep finally got to the front of the queue. A short discussion ensued, and we were told that we wouldn't be seen. It turned out that we didn't actually have an appointment, but had been promised one, unofficially, from the Sunday 9am session. I made my way back to work, arriving five hours after I had left.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/5909740194/" title="The Iranian Consulate by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6020/5909740194_4675dce012_t.jpg" width="100" height="66" alt="The Iranian Consulate" align="left"></a>Half an hour after sitting back down at my desk, back wet with sweat, I received an email from the Adventurists with the subject line "Visas". But no, it was not in regards to the Iranian visa, this was an email letting me know that the Russian Embassy had returned my passport, sans visa, because there were not enough blank pages in it. The email went on to say that I would have to get a new passport in order to get my Russian and Iranian visas. Now the rally starts in three weeks, can you guess what passport renewal turnaround is? Yes, three weeks. A fast-tracked passport costs Â£130, almost double the normal price. I don't know why the visa service that the Adventurists offer, The Visa Machine, doesn't check how many spare pages you have as the first thing they do. I know I had at least one spare page available per visa we were applying for, I didn't know how many I would need in total. The Visa Machine website <a href="https://visamachine.theadventurists.com/index.php?page=aboutvisas">states</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You MUST have 1 blank page free per visa (2 for some). A blank page must be completely free of all stamps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Adventurist I was emailing now told me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The requirement of every embassy is to have 2 spare pages at the time of application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suggested they amend their website.</p>

<p>So, assuming everything goes ok from now on, I will have two passports, half of my visas in one, and half in the other. I can see this going down really well with customs officials.</p>

<p>Jamie</p>

<p>UPDATE: We have since been informed that the finger print machine is broken and we will be able to get a visa without going back to the Consulate. Result.</p>
