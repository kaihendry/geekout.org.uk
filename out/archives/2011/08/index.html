<p>Yesterday was a bit of an adventure. We left Odessa fairly early, hoping to get
through Moldovia (there's no direct Ukraine - Romania border crossing) to the
Romanian side of the Danube Delta and a hotel that had been recommended to us
by a friend. I was a little dubious about the hotel as it looked expensive. We
had a look at the roads on Google maps and plotted a scenic route, that looked
fairly short by our recent standards. As we left Odessa we noticed a sign to
Reni, one of the border towns, pointing in the opposite direction, but we
decided to take the more scenic route along the coast.</p>

<p>The roads got steadily smaller and more pot-holed and slower, and we began to
realise why you might want to take a more main road the long way around. At one
point we took a wrong turn, but could have kept going, but we didn't want to
have to drive past a, very colourful, funeral procession, so we turned back. At
the crest of a hill, on a narrow, straight road lined with trees and mounds of
earth, we could see what lay before us. Two mud tracks either side of a large
concrete bridge. We decided to go for it.</p>

<p>I was driving and after a little while the car got a bit bogged down. We
stopped and I suggested going back. Kai pointed out that we'd actually come a
long way, and looking back I was amazed, driving it, it felt like no distance.
We paced it out and decided to go on. Kai got behind the wheel and managed to
drive the car up on to the brushy verge and got it to the bridge.</p>

<p>We had a look the other side of the massive slab of concrete that served as a
bridge and decided that the worst of it was over. I took back control and
drove. All went well until the track the car was straddling got larger and
larger until the car fell in. The bottom of the car was now resting on the mud.
This was when we started to realise how isolated we were, there really wasn't
another person or building to be seen for miles. I started scavenging for
useful items, and found some large rocks and a bit of old tractor tyre. Using
the rocks as a base we jacked the car up as far as we could and slid the tyre
under the wheel. With me lifting and Kai driving, we managed to get the car
free again, and made it back onto beloved <em>pot holed</em> tarmac.</p>

<p>If you haven't seen them already, Kai posted a couple of videos last night in
the <a href="../../../posts/The_Perils_of_using_Google_maps/">previous post</a>.</p>

<p>Even without that it would probably have been our slowest day yet doing just a
couple of hundred kilometers in about eight hours. Reaching the border town
Reni at about 7pm we were on the look out for somewhere to stop and spotted a
sign for camping, swimming, a restaurant and a hotel. We spent the better part
of two hours looking for that place. We did eventually find it. It turned out
to be a poor small hotel with a yard, and a great big hole in the yard.
Dispirited we left. Kai wouldn't hear of camping and we made it for the border.</p>

<p>The Ukranian - Moldovan border was quiet. We bought the "green card" insurance
on advice and the Moldovans took their time searching our car, which made me
very nervous, despite the fact I knew there wasn't anything in there that we
shouldn't have. After getting into Moldova we drove the 100 or so yards to the
Romanian border and spent a bit longer there waiting to get through, but didn't
get searched. By now it was getting on for 10:30pm and we were knackered so
went to <a href="https://www.hotelgalati.ro">hotel Galati</a> on the Romanian side. 
As we pulled up we were surprised to see three other Mongol Rally cars already
in the car park. It turned out that all of these teams had the same story, they
needed to wait for a V5, or an official letter of permission to drive the car, before
they could enter the Ukraine.</p>

<p>We took it easy this morning and after lunch made our slow way to the Danube
Delta. Reaching our <a href="https://wels.ro">recommended hotel</a> I again tried to
persuade Kai that we should camp. He promised to camp the next night, but
wanted to stay in the hotel. Unfortunately the hotel was full and I got my way.
<img src="../../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /> I don't want to tempt fate, but we found an absolutely perfect spot, and I
am typing this, sitting on one of our £5 ASDA camping chairs, the sun setting
behind me, the Danube Delta to my left and our car and tent to my right. The
only thing we can hear is the occasional fish jumping out of the water, the odd
frog ribberting and the odd wild dog barking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6000878574/" title="Woke up from some &quot;wild camping&quot; next to the Danube #mongolrally by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6143/6000878574_44ff567142.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="Woke up from some &quot;wild camping&quot; next to the Danube #mongolrally"></a></p>

<p>P.S. Our night was only slightly marred by the cloud of mosquitoes that joined us after 
sunset, and we ate our second sitting of noodles locked in the car. The night went fine,
although I have to say that the sound of dogs sniffing around the tent was a bit creepy.</p>

<p>Bulgaria was surprisingly OK. For me it's a strange mix of Russian (they
understand it, unlike the Romanians seemingly) and France (cute rustic
buildings and amazing countryside). Food is pretty bad and I'm totally
unconvinced on Bulgarian's sense of taste and style.</p>

<p>Varna and resorts to the south seemed popular for the English tourists and to
be honest the prices and women are quite attractive. Ahem.</p>

<p>So we quickly did the UNESCO tourist trap of Nessebar and headed into Turkey.
Border crossing was great... friendly staff and an initial hiccup with their
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/98788319923666944">computer failing</a>.
What a super drive. The scenery was stunning and dropping into Turkey was like
entering another world. Fantastic scenery.  Awesome sunset. Incredible.</p>

<p>Turkish roads and infrastructure seem amazingly good. We were a little worried
we forgot the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignette_(road_tax)">Vignette</a>, though we
picked up a KSG Auto-bahn card at a petrol station. We were easily averaging
100km/h and we made it into Istanbul with the help of Google maps... without
incident. Nuts. [Good driving, huh? - Jamie]</p>

<p>The 50EUR per night twin room hostel in Istanbul's Sultanahmet is a bit poor
value for money to say the least.  There seems to be a chasm between "hostel"
and "hotel" and it's really hard to bridge it. I am not interested really in
talking with tourists from UK and the West [unless they're good looking]. I'm
more keen to chat with locals.  A decent wifi Internet connection would be nice
too!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6008557642/" title="In Istanbul, not Constantinople"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6004/6008557642_9a60a54644_z.jpg" width="640" height="424"></a></p>

<p>Today the weather is pretty hot, though I've got the Blue Mosque, the
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6007851939/">bath</a> and the Sofia Mosque
out the way and I'm feeling pretty weak and dazed. There is a lot of history
here which makes me feel a little depressed tbh. Life is incredibly short in
the scheme of things and I worry a bit how I fit in...</p>

<p>Frustratingly Google Maps does not work (very strange) and we don't have a map
of Iran*. Can't help but feel our lack of planning ahead is catching up with us.
And finding information with a shit internet connection in Istanbul is crazy
hard compared to London.</p>

<p>Must thank Ruth who I contacted to help find some accommodation in Turkey for
us. I did another <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/99104332758265857">shout
out</a> for help
tomorrow, wonder if anyone gets it (Folks did!!
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/TurkeyTourismUK/status/99108049226186755">Thank</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ED8617/status/99145705771376640">you</a> ). I guess we
should just chance it, but it could easily cost us a lot of time. I'm keen to
spend 2-3 days in Tehran.</p>

<p>I've had the epiphany that Istanbul is well... the centre of the world. They
way it bridges continents and the understated Black and Aegean sea. It's just
insanely strategic. I want Turkey in the EU. <img src="../../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>* Jamie: After going to multiple bookshops and drawing a complete blank on
Iranian maps I was advised by a tourist agency to try the Iranian Consulate. I
pictured an office block, but arriving I found a gated community. Nervous I
asked the Turkish policeman on guard whether it was alright to bother them, he
said yes and upon entering I found a small man, who understood enough English
to give me a map of attractions. It doesn't have any roads on it but it's
better than nothing.</p>

<p>Quick update from the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6021067536">Hotel Grand

<p>We've done over 4k miles now! We covered some distance from Istanbul, Cappadocia, all
the way here to this Iranian border town.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6018436619/" title="Ballooning @ Cappadocia by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/6018436619_de6f6988c2_z.jpg" width="640" height="424" alt="Ballooning @ Cappadocia"></a></p>

<p>Cappadocia, although a tourist trap, was actually pretty good. Through the power
of my <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/TurkeyTourismUK/status/99108049226186755">twitter
network</a>, we
probably had the best hotel in Cappadocia at a good price. It had a pool, the
host Hassan arranged a balloon flight the next morning. Fantastic stuff.</p>

First the massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaymakl%C4%B1_Underground_City">underground city</a> and then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_of_G%C3%B6reme,_Turkey">Göreme Open Air Museum</a> - Jamie], we drove till dusk
and "wild camped" in a nice spot. The Turkish countryside has been stunning.</p>

<p>Today we are quickly going to check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishak_Pasha_Palace">Ishak Pasha
Palace</a> and then try the
Iranian border. Hopefully we'll be over by lunch and then get a 4-5hr drive to
Tabriz to check out another <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1346">UNESCO site</a>
on the way to Tehran.</p>

<p>Our "Interneting", i.e. our internet connectivity, twitter updates, blogs and
video uploads might come to a crashing halt. However we do have a SPOT messenger,
<a href="https://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0E4XTjiADylnLZeEL5e24gU0yUzxckg9Q">with map
updates</a>
however it is limited to only 41 characters. So if you wondering why <a href="https://twitter.com/kaihendry">my
tweets</a> are so short in Iran. That's why.</p>

<p>As that Queen song goes, it started off so well. We had made it out of Turkey
without paying anyone to carry our documents from our car 10 meters to the
check point, it was calm and relaxed and we hadn't seen any beards or even
guns. We'd had to be a bit patient while they checked our passports, and then
took our finger prints. Kai's for the second time as he'd already given them at
the Consulate in the UK, I'd thought I'd gotten away with it after their
machine broke, at the border we were back to old fashioned, reliable ink and
paper. We then gave them the carnet, our car's passport, and waited some more. </p>

<p>We chatted with the officials, they seemed very interested in us, we showed
them our Persian guide book on my Kindle (I'd previously removed Salmon Rushdie
and made sure not to show them that it could still access Twitter and
Facebook), they loved my tattoos, if laughing and pointing can be described as
"loved". </p>

<p>One guard in particular became quite interested in our car, pointing at stuff
and asking what it was. The first thing that sparked his interest was Kai's
Gerber multitool. He pointed at it and said "Gift?" I explained that it wasn't
mine. He then went to the back of the car and asked what the long red and blue
bags were. I explained that they were chairs (£5 from ASDA), and he got one
out, and sat on it, asking if it was made in England.  He called Kai over and
repeated the multitool-gift trick.</p>

<p>Kai searched for anything else that he might be happy with, trying to fob him
off with some "expensive" Cafe Direct tea, the guard asked if it was made in
England. Eventually Kai gave him one of his Geekout "KitKai" T-shirts, and he
was very happy, asking again if it was made in England. A little while later
our documents were ready, and we were asked for 20 Euros. This made me quite
cross. I thought we probably could have driven off, but Kai didn't want to piss
them off so I offered them 10, which was accepted. We were directed to customs,
which we missed and were turned back from the exit gates. We went to a small
green cabin, where we were given another slip of paper. We went to a manic
building with one small kiosk window and absolutely no form of queuing system
and worried that our documents had been lost somewhere.  We went back to the
green cabin and were asked how much we'd paid at the border. I was honest and
we were asked for another 10 Euros. We handed over 10 Turkish Lira, about 5
Euros and were finally allowed to leave.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Indeed Internet is an issue in Iran. My phone also stopped working. I think I
did manage to make an outgoing call in Tabriz, but in Tehran it does not
work... most of the time. Countless sites are filtered... one could use a VPN.
Though I can't be bothered to set one up on Archlinux, and the internet in Iran
is incredibly slow to begin with. [My Kindle still works, and seems to get past
the filter somehow - Jamie]</p>

<p>So since we can't post Flickr images easily or upload Youtube sites, I hope
you'll find words enough!</p>

<p>I just had the name "Bagh Golestan" to find a hotel in Tabriz. No map. So
navigating there, finding a hotel and parking was nothing short of a major
accomplishment. [More excellent driving ;)] Iranian driving is quite different
to Turkey and this is tbh the first time I haven't had Google Maps at my
disposal, so I had to talk to locals for directions(!)</p>

<p>The majority of Iranian people are friendly which is great. Other aspects like
the tourist sites, accommodation, internet sucking, food, crazy traffic and
stuff have made it a bit disappointing at least in my eyes. We did go see the
UNESCO market in Tabriz, and then we headed on the long drive to Tehran.
Fortunately the road started off really well and it was quiet I assume because
it was a toll road. It was a pleasure to drive. [No, it was really boring]</p>

<p>So petrol become a little issue, as it's all Iran state controlled as you may
or not know. Petrol stations were surprisingly hard to find and the attendants
tended to overcharge us until we requested it at 700 (7,000.00 IRR=0.410966
GBP) per litre (locals get it at 400). [That may be a misunderstanding on our
part, there are 17,000 Iranian Reals to the pound, but the locals often use
Tomans (sp?) which is 1/10 of a Real, and the number symbols are different. Put
all this together and they might have been telling us it was 7000 Reals a litre
and we thought they were asking for 1000 Tomans.  This seems especially likely
as the petrol pumps are pre-set.] We are not sure what Octane the "benzine" is,
but we fear it's not great quality judging by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_knocking">the sound of our motor</a>.
Nonetheless it's cheap to get around Iran.</p>

<p>In Tehran we navigated miraculously to a contact of ours pretty much in the
middle of town.  I used a pre-cache of Google maps Tehran, however the
pre-cache is a bit unusable since you can't search it off-line. Sigh... bad
Google. Interestingly Tehran is cut off into neighbourhoods so you have to
stick to these congested expressways and get off at the right place in order to
get into the neighbourhood. IIRC Baghdad has been described like this, and I
guess it's the same here. I assume it makes it very easy for a neighbourhood to
control things as they see fit.</p>

<p>I'm a bit nervous about revealing the identity of our friend of a friend's
wife, since she does seem to bend every rule in the Islamic handbook.
[Including driving western men around town that she's not even temporarily*
married to.]</p>

<p>Anyway she's been very hospitable to Jamie and I and we are learning a LOT
about Iran very quickly. [She's been averagely patient with Kai] I'll write
that all up in another post, another day.</p>

<p>* Apparently Islamic and Iranian law allows a couple to temporarily marry,
the man of course can take more than one full/temporary wife.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>We arrived after sunset in Yazd and begun the search for a hotel/hostel after
stopping at a juice shop next to the main mosque.</p>

<p>The three of us wandered around after a drink with the over-friendly juice bar owner. I
noticed a blonde youth lying on the lawn before the mosque and I approached him
and three other shrouded persons. Turned out to be four Germans returning from
volunteering in India to my surprise.</p>

<p>We chatted like excited travellers do, since I have not seen a European in Iran
since arriving. I casually commented that travelling through Pakistan into Iran
via Quetta must be dangerous and indeed it was for these Germans!</p>

<p>Evidently a mad religious gun man killed a host of people at a bus stop near
the border, forcing them to catch a plane instead. Crazy.</p>

<p>Anyway we commented on how friendly Iranians were and how badly our press at
home dealt with the situation.</p>

<p>The Germans had been staying a few days and they recommended a cheap hostel, so
that was good. The Germans left for Turkey and I spent some time looking at the
Mosque.</p>

<p>A group of friendly Iraqis approached me to join them with a Hookah. I chatted
with them in broken English and I was trying to say that wasn't Iran/Iraq on
bad terms? They dismissed my comment as that was Saddam Hussien. I asked them
why they were in Yazd, and they said because it's not as hot as Iraq.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if they were joking, because Yazd is bonkers hot. The
topic for the young guys turned to football and after trying to big up the
Spurs, I made my excuses and left.</p>

<p>I then chatted to the Hostel owner in German and then English, and he told me
an interesting story about Yazd. This was prempted with my story that I was
on the Mongol rally. He asked if I noticed the small corridors/streets of Yazd
with the high walls. Yes, I said. He then said Genghis Khan sacked Yazd, though
after some losses. Genghis layed siege to the city after losing many men to the
traps that were these corridors that exist today. And he lost men because if
you are not in the city of Yazd, you fall prey to its inhospitable conditions.
Genghis won eventually and destroyed the mosque completely to show his anger.
Must try confirm these stories.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>So our kind host and guide has been giving us an introduction to Middle class
Iranian life, as well as doing some sight seeing.</p>

<p>We drove up on the eastern hills of Tehran to a ski resort to take in some
hills and food. Then we visited some palaces and the bazaar back in Tehran.</p>

<p>In the evening we went to an upmarket cafe in northern Tehran and by that stage
I was starting to surmise the Iranian lifestyle, as not being all that
different from our own.</p>

<p>After reading Persepolis back in Bulgaria I was bracing myself for all sorts of
government intervention. Though the rebellious Iranian people seem to know how
how to avoid any trouble in their daily lives.</p>

<p>For example the next day we were travelling with our female guide south to
Esfahan and we were caught speeding at 135km/h, 15 above the speed limit of
120. After some friendly social interaction with the police, they let us go.
The traffic police in a blue car did ask our relationship which she answered
"friends", though it all seemed friendly. She later commented they shouldn't
have asked questions like that, since they are not the religious police who
drive green cars.</p>

<p>Later that day we visited some good historical houses in Kashan and then we
drove for an hour into the desert. At first as I was reluctant to go to a
desert, because I was worried we might get stuck in the sand, run out of petrol
and just die out there in the 40+ degree heat. I mean come on... we all can
imagine what a desert is like, can't we?</p>

<p>However the landscape slowly became quite fascinating, we came across a
biblical scene of goats and even a camel. Eventually we approached some dunes
which we spent a good hour climbing and watching the sunset. All in all, a
highlight of our trip so far.</p>

<p>By the time we left the desert, it was quite late and we even thought of staying
the night in Kashan. Instead we pushed on down to Esfahan. We travelled a
little quicker than usual, since we had the tip from a contact in Esfahan, that
the police do not trap at night.</p>

<p>We arrived at about midnight and were greeted by a couple of friends (an
Armenian and a lesbian!) in a coffee bar of our guide.</p>

<p>The lesbian drove us to a fast food place with incredibly garish headache
inducing neon lighting. The owner was throwing us strange looks and eventually
plucked up the courage to talk to us. He said he was a fan of T.S. Elliot.
Which was a bit strange, considering he was effectively running the equivalent
of McDonalds. I wanted a milkshake and he personally made me a banana milkshake
with saffron and it was the best milkshake I've ever had.</p>

<p>After this we crashed. We'd had quite an intense day.</p>

<p>I'm tired, my contacts hurt, it's hot and I am eeking out Internet in the Grand
Turkmen lobby surrounded by prostitutes.</p>

<p>Hello from Turkmenistan!</p>

<p>After a long drive from Tehran yesterday, we stayed in Goochan. The next day we
drove hungry to the border (no restaurants open on Ramazan of course). Luckily
Jamie stopped to cook up some noodles from a side road in the hills. If we
didn't I probably would have lost my mind later at the crossing.</p>

<p>At the border we bumped into a team from Iceland called <a href="https://mud-lab.com/">https://mud-lab.com/</a>.
Before we were thinking we must be one of the last teams. On the top of the
Iran side we bumped into "Team Tigers" and "Two random Germans" who have been
stuck waiting for a Turkmen invitation for <strong>days</strong>. So it was great to feel
that whole "Adventurists Mongol Rally" spirit again after a week in Iran.</p>

<p>The "Two random Germans" team asked to interview us which we agreed to, and
after an hour or two of processing we met them to give an interview. Little did
we know the Iranian official was waiting for us. He came over to us after a few
minutes to say "come back tomorrow". My heart sank and I really though we might
be trapped in Iran.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I love Iran and it was a real shame that official decided
to threaten us. Later he did let us cross.</p>

<p>Turkmenistan was almost more farcical than the Iran side. A ton of bureaucracy,
expense (we are completely out of US dollars) and we were through.
Unfortunately we had to tell them our route and later we thought this might
have been a mistake, since we might want to do a diversion to Darvaza, to the
"Gates of Hell".</p>

<p>Coming down from the mountainous border to Ashgabat was frankly incredible.  At
first one see a collection of modern-ish white building in the haze. As you get
closer you see architecture that looks like it came out of Star Wars. Tbh I
quite like the look, but it's just scarily unbelievable. I guess this might be
like Dubai. Most buildings looked wholly unoccupied... ummm this doesn't make
sense. [The heat of this city might mean that folks stay out of sight though.]</p>

<p>We drove in convoy with the Icelandic team and we were really worried about
getting our car fined since it was dirty. There is just too much weird stuff in
Turkmenistan for me to give it justice in this blog.</p>

<p>Over dinner with the Icelanders we remarked how odd if was to see a women's
hair and legs (the Russian speaking waitresses) after sipping some Baltika no.7
and clinking some local Vodka. Iran had affected us.</p>

<p>I wanted to quickly mention we met another team called "Mongols to Mongolia" in
the hotel restaurant which I found delightful. They are the first team of
Mongolians doing the rally from London back to their home Mongolia!!</p>

<p>I have a ton of cool video and pictures to upload, but sadly despite checking
into a recommended LP top pick with Internet. The internet is even WORSE than
Iran (FB, twitter etc. are filtered also), which is a remarkable achievement. I
really hope by Uzbekistan things improve, so we can share more. Also we have
absolutely no roaming on our phones (emergency calls only), so please email us.</p>

<p>Good night... when I wake up... Believe you me it's going to be one of those
WTF moments.</p>

<p>So we set off from our pitiful campsite too close to the main road to Dervaza
and drove back to Ashgabat. Since we left before 9am it wasn't so hot and the
ride went quite quickly. Except for the 3 times we were stopped by police and
the crazy 30km/h sign and the associated 15USD bribe.</p>

<p>Back in Ashgabat at midday we needed a break, so we decided to go back to Grand
Turkmen Hotel and pretend we were still guests. We enjoyed to the pool, tried
to use their internet and got some supplies from the Russian market opposite.</p>

<p>We then thought we should drive the 600km/s to Turkmenabat and get out of
Turkmenistan as there seemed plenty more to do in Uzbekistan. We left about
1pm.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the road running east of Ashgabat was very poor indeed. We made
slow progress as well as lost a hub cab, rattled and swerved the car through
mountains and valleys of warped asphalt shaped by heavy trucks no doubt.</p>

<p>Finally we arrived in Mary (200km off our target) an hour after sunset. My
impression of the time was surprisingly a very typical Soviet layout with a
large square and a horrendous looking Soviet style hotel at one end. In the
square we noticed a couple of busy looking restaurants and there we saw a red
Mongol rally car belonging to <a href="https://www.rallyteamamerica.com">Team America</a>.
We joined them and their Turkmen hosts for food and beer. [The food in Iran was
really very disappointing, and boring. I can't count the number of times we had
rice and kebab, and a grilled tomato if we were lucky. By comparison the
Turkmen food has been very good, particularly on this evening when we were
served braai-ed lamb with some very nice bread, which interestingly they call
"naan" - Jamie]</p>

<p>The Turkmen have been very friendly though it's pretty hard for us to
reciprocate when we are frankly exhausted and I speak very little Russian and
none of their Turkmen language.</p>

<p>Next phase was the four us trying to find a hotel. I tried to argue for the
more upscale one as I know that Russian budget options can be pretty fucking
awful. I'd rather start on the high end and then take steps down. The one
chosen was a motel a little outside town and thankfully a guy I met at the bar,
Max, helped direct us there, by riding in the car.</p>

<p>The motel is quite a sight. Lots of trucks parked to the side. A dark tree/bush
lined courtyard crawling with punters, pimps and whores.  The room looked like a
fight had occurred in it, judging by the broken fittings. [I know Kai will think
I'm being pedantic here, but it really wasn't "crawling", I saw one prostitute.
And the room was very tidy, not a fight scene. - Jamie] Nonetheless with the
revered A/C on, I had a good sleep after the mandatory shower.</p>

<p>After breakfasting on the usual carrot jam and boiled egg with bread that
tasted like a rug, we took a taxi to main Iman Khomeni square.</p>

<p>The square is an outstanding piece of Iranian architecture. With an amazing
tiled Mosque on one end, a square bizarre around the edge and a couple of
"historical houses" dotted above the bazaar.</p>

<p>I found the arts and crafts particularly good. Also the northern mural had a
depiction of a battle we've been informed between the Persians and our friends
the Portuguese.</p>

<p>After Mary we though we could cross the border at Turkmenabat that day, though
we decided to have a look at Merv. There was an old hill that was once a
settlement in 100AD or something, though the area was quite nice. Just lacking
some good information about it, since we were without Internet or a guide.</p>

<p>On the way to Turkmenabat Jamie and I hit a low point. Jamie got the car stuck
on sand and the people helped us out of us then demanded money for their
generosity. Not cool.</p>

<p>By the time we approached Turkmenabat at 5-6pm, it was far too late to cross
the border. We then spent another hour or two trying to find a hotel. We
eventually found the LP recommend one, but they said we must go to the new
Jehun hotel. This is typical Turkmenistan weirdness. Foreigners are denied a
stay in any hotel. Also it's quite hard to get A-95 fuel, unless you're a VIP
or something.</p>

<p>At the hotel we found <a href="https://www.rallyteamamerica.com/">Team America</a> who had been hanging around for hours they
claim which we found surprising and a little depressing since we honestly tried
to push that day. Nonetheless we enjoyed Lex &amp; Jeff's company, whilst geeking
out with a few beers.</p>

<p>The next day (today), we aimed for the border. <a href="https://www.rallyteamamerica.com/">Team America</a> had to fill up, so
we had a head start. The border experience was once again a kafka-esque
experience that I'm trying to forget. Firstly it was near impossible to <em>find
the border</em> since there were no signs. We had to pay a small "fine" on the
Uzbek side since Jamie drove through the disinfectant pool too fast, which was
not true. We were at the border for over four hours and strangely we didn't see
<a href="https://www.rallyteamamerica.com/">Team America</a>. I wonder where they are. We did bump into the Mongolian team
again, which was nice. They escaped Turkmenistan by paying a 42USD fine for
overstaying their visa, since they were waiting for their Uzbek visa.
<strong>Nightmare</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally I'm here in Bukhara, home of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game">Great
Game</a>. We're in the old city which
feels like a bit of an oasis. A few French tourists, another Mongol Rally car
and sweet Internet. Roaming on my mobile also works to great relief. It wasn't
working on the border.</p>

<p>[There was one positive to take from the Uzbek border crossing, it was the first
border where I had to use a visa in my old passport. The guards just laughed at
me. One down, three to go. Jamie]</p>

<p>[ps, Team America have just emailed to say that we missed a step and the border guards were saying that we should go back :-/]</p>

<p>About 40 years ago, 300 odd kilometers north of Ashgabat in Turkmenistan some
noxtious gases were seeping out of the ground at a drilling site. It was
decided to burn off the gases and so they were lit. The ground collapsed, the
rig fell into the hole, and the fire has been burning ever since. It's quite a
sight, and tourists have been going to have a look ever since. Now apparently
the Turkmen authorities don't like tourists, and I imagine the whole episode
was a bit of an embarrassment, so they took the logical step and raised the
local village, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derweze">Darvaza</a>, to the ground
(leaving the bread oven standing due to religious reverance) to desaude
visitors. It is against this backdrop that Kai and I left Ashgabat yesterday
afternoon and headed north.</p>

<p>Driving 300km through desert is a thirsty business and by the time we got to
what I assume had once been Darvaza, complete with lone bread oven and a handy
wall to hide the car behind, we'd already drunk about half of the water we had
with us. We also hadn't seen a petrol station since just outside Ashgabat.</p>

<p>Just before Darvaza, suspiciously close infact, had been a police check point.
This panicked us a bit, hence the hiding of the car, and we decided to wait
until dark and then walk the last three miles through the desert to the "hell
mouth".  Not quite as crazy as it sounds as Kai had already put the coordinates
into his GPS device.</p>

<p>Walking through the desert was a little spooky. Kai claims he saw a snake, but
it could have just been a moving stick <img src="../../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";)" /> Gradually in the distance we started
to see a slight glow on the horizon, and after climbing yet anouther ridge we
saw...  the moon. But all was not lost, there was definitely something else
glowing out there. After a total of about an hour and a half we did eventually
reach the great fire pit. It was nice, very peaceful and we scaled an
overlooking hill and sat for a while.</p>

<p>While it was nice to see, and walking through the desert was an experience, I'm
not sure I'd recommend it, or at least not the way that we did it. There is
apparently a track that leads to it if you can find it, or you can try to find
a guide, and you can camp nearby. As we returned and were getting close to the
car we heard a motorbike behind us, which by the time we got to the car had
caught up with is, and at just the same, as if on schedule, two other
motorbikes drew up, from opposite directions. The riders seemed to want to take
us on a tour of the flame pit. We tried to explain that we'd already been. They
stayed and chatted and gave us some chewing tobbacco, which was a bit strong,
and asked for gifts. Luckily we had some cigarettes and a pen and they left
eventually.</p>

<p>I'm drunk and emotional as I write this.</p>

<p>For those who only have a few weeks left of their life, then I recommend the
Mongol Rally. It's full of life experiences.</p>

<p>I'm getting a bit emotional, especially as we met the Italian team <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/highwaytokhan">Highway to
Kahn</a> over beers in Samarqand [rhymes with
TravelPussy]. Jamie and I took quite an intrepid route like many other
ralliers, to the south through Iran. Getting through Iran and Turkmenistan
especially is not easy let me tell you.</p>

<p>Furthermore we have the Pamir Highway to do, which some other teams aren't doing. So
this adds a week to our itinerary. Especially since we have now discovered there
is no direct crossing between Samarkand and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushanbe">Dushanbe</a>.</p>

<p>There are many very hard days of planning, driving and finding accommodation
ahead of us. Even if things go well, we predict we will be in Mongolia around
the ~12th of September. More than a week after the last Finish line party.</p>

<p>I really hope we don't have a massive anti-climax once we reach Ulanbataar. We are
really working very very hard on finishing and we hope we get some recognition
from at least our friends and family.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>We had a really good day today, despite some really depressing news last night.
As Kai wrote, yesterday we crossed into Uzbekistan, which was probably one of
the least pleasant border crossings yet, but still the hardest bit is remaining
patient. However last night I happened to check my emails, the first time in a
while as internet was really hard to come by in Turmenistan, and Team America
had emailed warning that the Uzbek border guards had been wondering where we
were as we had "missed a step", and needed to go back to get our "yellow form".
As we'd left I did wonder how come we still had both copies of our customs
declaration forms.</p>

<p>So we made the decision this morning to go back. I was in more of a mind to
risk it, but Kai has become risk-averse of late. Good thing too. It was also
lucky that we hadn't gone all the way to Samarqant as I had suggested as there
would have been no way we would have wanted to drive back the 700 odd km to the
border. (To be honest Buxoro was nicer to visit than Samarqant anyway.)</p>

<p>So after a few last trips to the toilet in our water-less hostel, we left at
about 8:30am and made good progress, getting back to the border at about
9:30am. In contrast to the day before the border was very quiet and we got back
to the customs office easily. There the two male and female guards recognised
us, pretended to be cross with us, told us that we must thank the friends who
notified us as we would now be able to leave the country, and sent us on our
way. The guards outside were a bit annoyed when I played with their attack dog,
it was so cute, but still didn't have any water.</p>

<p>We then made quick time back to Buxoro for a very good lunch (I opted for beef
shashlik again, as it was so good last night. Kai's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf">plov</a> was very good too,
which I was surprised at) stopping only to see if we could get some fuel from
one of the very few open petrol stations which all have very long queues
outside. I walked down to check that they had 95 octane "benzene" and we were
waved in, past all the locals (sorry locals).</p>

<p>We made it to Samarqand for about 6, stopping once so that Kai could take a dip
in a very grey/brown fast flowing river, which we had a job getting him out of.</p>

<p>Hopefully tomorrow we will make it to and through the Tajik border, stay the
night and start the Pamir Highway on Monday.</p>

<p>Before we started this trip I was a bit concerned as Kai was always talking
about two months, while my work had given me 6-7 weeks. Once we started however
it was me who was suggesting we spend a bit more time in, for instance, Iran,
and Kai was then getting nervous about being left behind by the rest of the
ralliers. When we left Iran I was quite happy with our progress as we'd done
about 6500 miles in three and a bit weeks and only had about 2000 left to go.
However, one day into Turkmenistan, driving to Mary, and I realised how a bad
road can turn your 800km days into 200km days and so many small countries means
the border crossings start to eat up time and I began to get nervous. Since
Mary the roads have been much better, hopefully they  won't get too bad, else I
might have to leave Kai to finish the rally on his own <img src="../../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";)" /></p>

<p>After being frankly disappointed by Samarqand town, I was looking forward to
getting into Tajkistan to do the Pamirs.</p>

<p>We crossed from Denov from the south as advised by our kind host Zafar.
Unfortunately the direct border has been closed from 2001. So it was quite a
long drive and thankfully we did find a place with petrol along the way.</p>

<p>For the first time we looked close at our Tajik visas and my heart sank as I
saw the visa expires on the 24th and it was the 21st. I allocated 1 week in my
mind to do Pamirs, there was no way we could do it!</p>

<p>The Uzbek/Tajik border near Denov was probably our quickest, but we had to pay
10USD bribe / dodgy admin fee and the car insurance seemed to be negotiable
from 45USD down to 25USD. All very silly.</p>

<p>Getting into Dashunbe in darkness was not so bad, since there was good car I
followed all the way into town. I was copying his every move and flinch through
pot-holed roads. Next finding the recommended hostel "Adventurer's Inn" must have
consumed a good hour, but we found it after a taxi driver rode with us for
5USD.</p>

<p>We then tried to get some food which always seems to be a chore. Everyone
eats at sundown and then seemingly closes up. Nonetheless we ordered an
expensive Chinese take out, which later transpired could have fed four.</p>

<p>Jamie chatted to the English and rag tag bunch of "adventurers" in the Inn.
Most if not all were cycling or motorbiking the Pamirs. Although many of them
took weeks if not an entire month, though they all agreed we could do it in
the time we had.</p>

<ul>
<li>Down south from Dushanbe to Kulob, up and around to Horugh should take 15hrs (22nd)</li>
<li>Horugh to Murghab (23rd)</li>
<li>Mughab to the Kyrgyz border for the 24th (the same day the visa expires)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tbh I previously thought Osh was in Tajikistan, so I agreed to this plan.
Previously I assumed we had to go straight up to Kyrgystan to avoid
over-running our visa.</p>

<h2>The Pamirs</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6087820791/" title="Road Clearage by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6070/6087820791_ebc493f782_m.jpg" width="240" height="159" alt="Road Clearage"></a></p>

<p>So we woke early. Jamie had a bad night sleep as there weren't any free beds
that night. I had the shits all night, so I pledged I would not eat meat again.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6088367502/" title="Snooze by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6084/6088367502_a596213dd0_m.jpg" width="159" height="240" alt="Snooze"></a></p>

<p>The long drive to the Pamir Highway itself, from Dushanbe through Kulob, turned
out to be some of the most spectacular driving, possibly even more so than the
the traditional M41 Pamir highway itself. It started winding up and down bigger
and bigger hills, eventually turning into very colourful mountains and sheer
drops.  The going was fairly slow, as we were quite concious of the terrible
condition of the road and our tiny front wheel drive car. We even had to stop
while a very large landslide was cleared by some heavy machinery.</p>

<p>We reached the Pamir proper, where there is a roaring river separating
Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and it was stunning.  The road was quite
challenging at first, then we later got used it and in fact started to enjoy
it.</p>

<p>After camping near Kevron (where the M41 hits Afghanistan) on quite a nice spot
on the River (Afghanistan a stone throw away), we woke up to drive to
<a href="../../../posts/Tajikistan/">Horugh</a> which is also known as Khorog, depending on how the
Cyrillic is transliterated (so annoying).</p>

<p>We were feeling pretty bad because we were supposed to be in Khorog that night
in order to keep to the plan to do the Pamirs in just 3 days in order not to
overrun our Tajikistan visa.</p>

<p>When we finally arrived in Khorog around lunch we were delighted that we caught
up with the <a href="https://mud-lab.com/">Icelanders</a> who we've hung out before in
Turkmenistan. We were convinced they were a day ahead of us, so we were really
surprised we somehow caught up with them.</p>

<p>We also came across an Ambulance rally team who were stuck in Khorog because of
some repairs they needed. They said they predicted they would only be in Almaty
on the 2nd of September (last Mongol Rally party is on the 3rd in UB). All this
time I had thought we were running incredibly late. I'm writing this
from Almaty and we plan on leaving on the 29th, so we are days and days ahead
of that convoy we came across in the Pamirs.</p>

<p>So we hastily pushed on east on the Pamir in convoy with Thor, Gunnar &amp; Ale,
and we made good progress. The roads were actually quite alright, it was only
the first stretch around Khist where it was crazy.</p>

<p>We didn't make Murgarb and by nightfall but we found a "Yurt hotel" and agreed
on 50USD for 5 of us to sleep there, including a dinner of Plov and a breakfast of 
slightly sour, undercooked rice pudding.</p>

<p>I've never stayed in a yurt before, though after freezing my ass off in there
with a bit of altitude sickness (we were at 4200m+), I must say I am not keen
on ever staying in a yurt again. Our hostess was very nice, but it was clear to
me she was extremely poor so the food et al was pretty unsophisciated and
meagre by my snobbish standards.</p>

<p>The next day we made a bid for the border in order not to overrun our visa.</p>

<p>So after waking up in the yurt after an uncomfortable night's sleep we packed
up early for a dash to Murghab where we should have been that morning and onto
the border.  We met An American <a href="https://brucealmaty.wordpress.com/author/brucealmaty/">Team Bruce
Almaty</a> and a South
African solo team named Guy there, which was nice. We also took on an Israeli
hitchhiker called Dal who was desperate to get to Bishkek by the 26th for a
flight to India, which was the matched our itinerary.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6088376870/" title="DSC_9992 by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6086/6088376870_32e9d1bc1e.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="DSC_9992"></a></p>

<p>We were a bit nervous as we heard a couple of reports of challenging roads once
we set off. We went through one after another fearing that was worse to come,
and we were all surprised when we unexpectedly hit the border. The border was
just a shack where it looked like a checkpoint that we've seen time and time
again.</p>

<p>We struggled to pay the least possible bribe and eventually settled on $10 for both teams.</p>

<p>At this point we had a flat and another tyre had a bulge in the side the size
of a golf ball, so we did the Pamirs with some scars to prove it. As usual we
completed a major leg of the journey and it was an anti-climax. It is difficult
to celebrate when you're exhausted and there is no champagne. <img src="../../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";)" /></p>

<p>We pushed onto Osh and after some insane night driving where there was far too
many animals and other dangers on the road. We checked into a LP recommendation
Hotel Altai and it was absolutely abysmal. Nothing worked, not even in the taps
in the room.</p>

<p>The next day we wanted to deal with the two tyres before setting off on the
10hr drive to Bishkek. We found the "Car (Machina) Bizaare" with the help of
Team Bruce Almaty and we hoped we could get everything sorted in a bit more
than an hour, in order to leave by midday.</p>

<p>Two hours later, blood, sweat, tears and ~30USD lighter we managed to get both
done. What was silly was that the power for the block was out, so I to search
out a place with a generator. It also didn't help the first second hand tyre we
were sold had a massive hole in it. The next one was the wrong size, slightly
bigger. We didn't notice until we drove off with it.  So now when we hit a bump
on the back right side, we can hear it hitting the wheel arch!</p>

<p>Nonetheless we moved on with Dal still in the back. It soon transpired we could
not close on Bishkek, though we managed to find a pleasant hotel in Totagul on
the way. Early next morning we aimed for Almaty.</p>

<h2>Jamie's Day</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6084575879/" title="Jamie fixes a puncture by Kai Hendry, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6208/6084575879_f030d7198d_t.jpg" width="75" height="100" align="left" alt="Jamie fixes a puncture"></a>After spending most of the night weeing out of my bottom in the absolutely disgusting, 
but thankfully en suite and functional (unlike the "shower" or basin)
toilet of our room at Hotel Altai (I
must appologise to the four other people sharing the room) I wasn't exactly feeling
great. As I didn't think stopping every five mintutes for a toilet break was really
an option I decided to take something to stop the diarrhea, and then we went out
for a hearty breakfast, one of the heariest breakfasts we've had. Taking Imodium and then
eating a large meal is not something that I recommend. As we looked around the tyre market
in the heat and checked out a few prospective tyres
I felt sicker and sicker. Really like the food in my stomach had nowhere to go. I just
prayed that it wouldn't go upwards. Kai took the bulging tyre off to be changed and left
me with the car. I got the punctured spare out and started the process of fixing it
using the Crafty Plugger kit I'd brought from London, battling with a kid from one of
the tyre places who thought, wrongly, that he knew how to use it better than I did. The 
sun beat down. I got a bowl out of the car and prepared for the worse. </p>

<p>Two days later and I have finally recovered. I swear I will never drink that fizzy yak's
milk again. Though having said that no one else was fool enough to drink it, and they
all came down with the same symptoms, at some point.</p>

<p>I was fearing the border crossing to Kazakhstan from Kyrgyzstan, just north of
Bishkek and most of my fears came true*. I would like to call it the worst
border crossing I've been to, though all in all, despite some confusion, we
crossed in probably 2 hours, which is pretty remarkable. Still the fact that
people in camouflaged balaclavas are milling around the Kazakh side armed to
the teeth was a bit unnerving to say the least.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6087836815/" title="Meet Up by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6087836815_038626ede8.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="Meet Up"></a></p>

<p>We filled up without issue and on we went to Almaty [Pronounced Al-Murray]. We
then spotted a Mongol Rally ambulance in a scenic lay-by (above). We
stopped, chatted and with the 3 girls and 2 boys of that team [They hadn't seem
to have decided on a name] and they kindly made us some Earl Grey tea.  Yes,
they were English too. They had been in Kazakhstan for 3 days already, and were
taking it slow.</p>

<p>We made it to Almaty, a place I actually visited 7 years ago, to be met with my
old Russian Kazakh friend Ivan. I incorrectly remembered Almaty as being quite
small and initially I felt confident I would find the centre. Second time
around Almaty seems to have changed dramatically. Many more cars and buildings.</p>

<p>Ivan did find me and on we went together with the 3 Icelanders to find an
apartment. The first lady swiftly excused herself from offering a flat after
seeing us... 3 of us had long beards, all of us had tans, shorts and looked
pretty ragged.</p>

<p>Eventually Jamie and I stayed at Ivan's and we found a place for the 3
Icelanders really close to city centre. Not without incident, since we had
dinner before where we all had a glass of beer. Ivan then said, in no uncertain
terms that we could not possibly drive, since Kazakhstan is zero tolerant on
alcohol (which we didn't know, apparently enforced by police using just their
noses).  We tried to go out though a couple of us still had diarrhoea and the
bar we initially went to had a private function. At 1am we were all glad to get
some sleep. What a long day...</p>

<p>Speaking with Ivan the next day, he seemed incredulous that we have driven all
this way. Through Kyrgyzstan which he regards as being very unsafe, and then
onto Russia which is 3 days solid drive away. He also informed us there is a
petrol crises in Kazakhstan, making it hard to find fuel. Not again I
thought... most of central Asia and even Iran can have long queues for petrol.
It was particularly bad in Uzbekistan. Though we have avoided most issues so
far, I guess mainly due to friendly locals sharing private stock.</p>

<p>The days we spent recovering and catching up on the few days we were off the
Internet. The Icelanders left for Astana yesterday (Sunday 28th), though I was
too ill to leave. Also Ivan's mother was very kindly cleaning our laundry.</p>

<p>It's Monday morning now and we've packed up after enjoying a couple of poached
eggs for breakfast. It's time for the 16-20hr drive north to Astana.</p>

<p>* False. Kai told me that the Kazakh border would be the most corrupt and
dodgy border that we would encounter. I was asked for $10 in order to re-enter
the border after accidentally leaving it, but I didn't pay and we didn't lose
any money or possessions, unlike many other borders that we have crossed so
far.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>The drive to Astana was very long but fairly uneventful. If you have a look at
<a href="https://geekout.org.uk/map/">the map</a> you can see we drove around a very large lake in the south of the
country, which was an absolutely <a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=45.759859,76.168213&amp;spn=4.522295,9.854736&amp;t=h&amp;z=7&amp;vpsrc=6">beautiful perfect turquoise colour</a>, not unlike
the Kazakh flag, maybe that's where it comes from.</p>

<p>Darkness fell between 7 and 8 when we still had a considerable distance to go.
By that point we'd driven for about 12 hours and covered about 3/4 of the
1100km (passing our 10,000th mile on the way). Passing through Karagandy there
were a couple of signed detours along surprisingly bad roads, considering that
we were travelling from Kazakhstan's biggest city to its capital. At one point
I was following a couple of cars along a flyover when they drove around a small
road block. I followed, not thinking much of it. Then we came to another road
block and both cars turned off the road. I followed. The road got smaller and
smaller until it was barely a dusty track. We crossed several railway tracks.
Kai started to freak out. Just as I was beginning to wonder if we should turn
around we found tarmac again, and eventually met the main road again.</p>

<p>Incredible. Relief.</p>

<p>Reaching Astana at midnight we managed to find a hotel very quickly, and went
straight to bed. We'd been driving for 16 hours.</p>

<p>The stories of Astana we'd heard in Almaty led me to imagine something along
the lines of Ashgabat, lots of new but empty and useless/already fading
buildings. But actually it was pretty normal as things go. Kai and I went to
see the Norman Foster "tent" this morning. It looked disappointedly small from
the outside, but it does manage to contain a six story shopping mall. As a
measure of how bright it is here, I took a picture <em>inside</em> the shopping mall
at ISO 100.</p>

<p>We're now rushin' to Russia. We'll probably camp tonight, hopefully inside
Russia, and make Novosibirsk tomorrow.</p>

<p>We just made the Kazakhstan/Russia border by night fall. It was a little windy
and some of the coldest weather we've experienced since Europe. The Kazakh
guards were all very friendly, and unusually thorough.  Our car got its first
semi-decent search, they got us to take everything out of the boot and even had
a look at the spare, though not really checking the rest of the car. As ever
they asked beforehand if we were carrying any heroin. We proceeded to passport
control where my two passports were given even more attention than normal.
Slowly more and more senior officials were called, until a small huddle formed,
all looking at my passports in puzzled silence, as if they were trying to crack
a particularly hard maths problem or crossword clue. The trouble is, once
they've decided there's a problem they can't really just let you through
without loosing face, you have to come up with some new piece of evidence for
them to go "Aaaah, that's ok then." Eventually I pointed out, for the second
time, that upon entering the country I'd had both my visa (in my old passport)
stamped <em>and</em> my new passport stamped, and we were on our way.</p>

<p>Russia is a serious country and I was expecting a serious border, but it was
actually one of the easiest entries we've had. <em>The</em> easiest I would say, very
quick and straight forward.</p>

<p>By this time it was 9pm and very dark. We'd always planned to camp the other
side of the border as Novosibirsk was quite a drive away, and we'd had to leave
Kazakhstan as you have to register after five days and we were on our fifth
day. So we drove a little way into Russia, turned into a side road, drove
enough of a distance to be hidden from the road (so we thought) setup camp and
had noodles with egg for dinner. Again.</p>

<p>We were awoken by the sound of a vehicle. It was definitely coming towards us.
I knew it was going to stop at our tent. It stopped at our tent. There was a
shout. Probably in Russian. I reluctantly unzipped the door. There were three
Russian soldiers with guns standing around their Lada 4x4. Kai got up and I
started to pack away our things. We didn't share much in the way of language,
but once they'd seen our passports they left. We weren't sure if they wanted us
to leave or not, but three guys with guns worked pretty well as an alarm clock
and it was past 7am so we decided to leave, without even the cup of tea we'd
offered the soldiers.</p>
