<p>Bought a <a href="https://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=116">SPOT connect</a> <em>geek
gadget</em> so that you can track our progress and we can post short &lt;41char
updates!</p>

<p>I bought the device from a UK distributor <a href="https://www.globaltelesat.co.uk/">Global Telesat
Communications</a> and I found it a tough
decision to purchase, because the hardware costs 150GBP and the upkeep is 100+
GBP a year plus extras. Extras like a SOS extraction service I've yet to figure
out.</p>

<p>After receiving the device (which I've since called <em>puck</em>) in London, I tried
it though I frustratingly couldn't get a message out. The <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.spotllc.spotconnect.app">Android
application</a>
was a little disappointing, and to actually send a message doesn't seem
instant. It seems to queue up and sends it over a ~10 minute interval... So the
whole experience from the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.spotllc.spotconnect.app">Spot connect Android
client</a> is a
bit ridiculous. Watch bluetooth sap the Nexus S's battery until the message
finds a window to be sent (perhaps).  There is no confirmation on the client
itself whether it sent or not, only on the puck itself, when it blinks red,
meaning that it failed...</p>

<p>Days later in Steyning, I managed to send a couple of messages (to <strong>great relief</strong>),
though they did not appear on a "Public shared map" I created:</p>

<p><a href="https://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0E4XTjiADylnLZeEL5e24gU0yUzxckg9Q">https://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0E4XTjiADylnLZeEL5e24gU0yUzxckg9Q</a></p>

<p>Also my initial "testing 123" check-in message was written days back in London,
however it only had the timestamp of when it was actually sent today. So...
that sucks.</p>

<p>So far the SPOT service does seem quite unpolished, though I hope the SPOT
customer services will come through to make this work better for us. My next
biggest concern is how long the batteries work. 2x<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_battery">AA
batteries</a> will track <a href="../../../about/">Team
Geekout</a> for how long ? Pity it doesn't have a USB charge interface.</p>

<p>Campbell Irvine is the de facto travel insurance firm for the Mongol Rally. When I contacted them I was quoted £117 for 45 days or £142 for 62 days. Kai then got wind of an annual (maximum 70 day) policy for £99. Having enquired there apparently is nothing extra included in the more expensive, shorter periods of insurance, so I requested, and received, a refund. It's a bit of a con if you ask me.</p>

<p>Since <a href="/posts/Not_the_Best_Day_of_My_Life/">I last wrote</a> much has happened, but not much seems to have changed. I got a new passport, at great expense. My old passport, containing four of my seven required visas has had a very large corner cut off the data page, meaning there's no way I'll be able to fool border guards into thinking that it's valid. I've been told I don't need to return to the Iranian Embassy, Masha'Allah, as their finger print machine is broken. I've been told various things about the validity of the four visas in my old passport, ranging from the Kyrgyzstan Embassy telling me that I needed to get a completely new visa, through the Adventurists telling me that the Kyrgyzstan border guards are very relaxed to a very chilled Uzbek Embassy worker telling me that everything would be fine. I've had to pay for my Russian and Mongolian visas to be expedited. The amount of money this is costing is getting ridiculous. Apparently there is much nervousness over at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/219322734774041">the Facebook group</a> as no one seems to have their Russian, Iranian or Mongolian visas, according to the website.</p>

I took a photo of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/5938270174/in/photostream">the template</a> in case it would be useful to anyone else.</p>

<p>Parcel upon parcel has been arriving at my parents' house, mostly technology that Kai has ordered, I am wondering whether we will be able to fit it all in the car. I got a distinctly old fashioned <a href="https://www.navitron.org.uk/forum/index.php?action=dlattach%3Btopic=4308.0%3Battach=1572%3Bimage">Kelly Kettle</a> for my birthday from Mum, which at least we don't need another cigarette lighter adapter for.</p>

<p>I came back to my parent's this weekend hoping to do a last shop for tools and spares, but unfortunately Pete at Steyning Motor Spares hasn't had his delivery yet and doesn't know what he will/won't have. And Hove Motor Spares still doesn't have an extra spare for us. Being a teacher my mum is on holiday from Tuesday, so I might be calling on her time somewhat as I am working right up until we leave.</p>

They contacted me on Thursday asking about Turkey as they were <a href="https://mongoliarally.tumblr.com/post/7647289663/access-denied">stuck at the Ukraine border</a>. They're now going north through Lithuania and Latvia on a bit of a detour.</p>

<p>I also forgot to mention that Kai's also got himself a special T-shirt too.</p>

<p>Today I managed to remove Josh's cleverly bolted on sump guard to change the oil and oil filter. Several people had suggested doing it and when I checked the Haynes Manual it said to change the oil and filter every 4,500 miles. Meaning that even now we should really be looking to change it en route too.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/301264206907?ap=1">Facebook groups</a> are a
bit of a black hole when it comes to information, I thought I'd copy &amp; paste
some useful tidbits.</p>

<p>From Warrick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>£1 GBP =</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>1.60 $ USD</li>
  <li>1.14 EURO</li>
  <li>28 Czech Koruna</li>
  <li>4.85 Romanian New Leu</li>
  <li>116 Serbian Dinar</li>
  <li>2.23 Bulgarian Lev</li>
  <li>2.66 Turkish Lira</li>
  <li>17000 Iranian Rial</li>
  <li>4.57 Turkmenistani Manat</li>
  <li>2778 Uzbekistani Som</li>
  <li>234 Kazakhstani Tenge</li>
  <li>72 Kyrgyzstani Som</li>
  <li>45 Russian Ruble</li>
  <li>1978 Mongolian Tughrik</li>
  <li>10.38 Chinese Yuan Renminbi</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And James on the merits of the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/5869205510">IDP</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of negotiating later, and blunt refusal by the corrupt bastard, we got it
  back for $200. ALWAYS show the International Driving License, and buy two of
  them. They're basically disposable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still I think leaving a policeman with your disposable drivers license and then
driving away sounds like a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>From observing hard negotiating Israelis in India, I think good negotiation is
about <strong>persistence</strong>. I plan to brush up on my weak Russian (&amp; learn Farsi?),
stay positive, polite and friendly and let the fun begin.</p>

<p>Jamie and I set off from Goodwood yesterday. What stress.</p>

<p>I moved several bags of my stuff down to West Sussex via Victoria and luckily a
friend was around to help with the move!</p>

<p>I met with Larry and Jamie at Shoreham-by-Sea and the next morning Larry
thankfully helped cleaned the car. He designed the our team "Geekout" logo and
a whole bunch of delightful stickers for our car.</p>

<p>When we eventually got to Goodwood via Google Navigate which took us to the
horse race course via some odd country lanes, the car looked a bit plain.
Though whilst Jamie and I were registering et al, Larry applied the decals.
Nice.</p>

<p>I was super stressed since I thought we might be off as early as 2pm and my
parents said they were running late and would probably arrive around er.. 2pm.
I told them to bring some BBQ stuff, but as it transpired, no BBQs are allowed
at Goodwood circuit, despite the fact there was only one catering van and quite
a large number of people. I became stressed &amp; starved. Not a good start, though
my parents did see my off with heartfealt hugs.</p>

<p>So we set off for the Chunnel and after the buzz of going around the circuit,
Jamie almost hit a car as we were pulling out (he was looking the wrong way)!</p>

<p>So there were quite a few Mongol ralliers on the road to cross over to France.
Lots of waves and good spirits. We met a solo Belgian driver named Rick who
also has a CB radio. We chatted on the way to Folkstone which really helped
pass the time. There are quite a lot of ralliers, though I would estimate only
5-10% have CBs, so I doubt we are going to get much use out of of it.</p>

<p>350 miles or so later we arrived at JHQ via Queens Avenue. A British base my sister
was celebrating her last day on. Her and a couple of friends were dressed up
as Amy Winehouse and doing a tribute. Her friend Paul seemed genuinely
interested in our rally and we chatted for a bit and wound down with a German
beer.</p>

<p>The next day we woke early as Jutta had an early flight back to England, so we
left too. We said our goodbyes in the rain and now we are headed off to Dresden
to stay with a very good friend Felix from India. Actually he's German, but we
met in India.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>We've just reached the Czech Republic after spending a very pleasant evening
and morning in Dresden with Kai's friend Felix. Curry wurst was a bit
disappointing, think sausages swimming in slightly spicy tomato ketchup, but
Felix's traditional German aloo gobi for dinner and cold meat and boil egg
breakfast was excellent.</p>

<p>As Kai mentioned in the previous post our first stop was with his sister Jutta
and two other Amy Winehouse tribute acts in West Germany. Jutta proved more
observant than the two of us noticing almost immediately that our <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6226478005">Dunlop
sticker</a>, provided my my
creative flatmate Larry, was spelt slightly unusually, with an extra "p" coming
after the "Dun".</p>

<p>We've been using a TomTom so far, and while it's very convenient I dislike them
intensely. It seems to me they remove all sense of where you are and where
you're going. The maps don't run out until at least Turkey <img src="../../../smileys/ohwell.png" alt=":-/" /></p>

<p>Apparently you cannot use foreign bank cards in Iran. I wish I'd brought some
pounds with me as now I will be charged twice, once to withdraw the money
elsewhere and again to exchange within Iran.</p>

<p>Talking of Iran, we're already finding the car quite hot, Kai's thermometer
reading around 27C and the air from the vents seems to be constantly warm,
although maybe that's just the ambient temperature.</p>

<div class="inlinecontent">
<p>Yesterday we experienced our first proper border crossing, from Poland into the
Ukraine. We left Krakow at around midday and had a fairly long though good
drive through Polish countryside on good roads. We arrived at the Ukrainian
border at about five and joined the back of a long, snaking, stagnant line of
cars and trucks.</p>

<p>After a couple of minutes we were amazed to see another Mongol Rally Micra draw
up right behind us. It was Ed and Matt of <a href="https://mongolrally11.theadventurists.com/index.php?mode=teamwebsites&amp;name=ice-cold-in-ulaanbaatar">Ice Cold In
Ulaanbataar</a>.
We chatted, I thought about brewing up. And then a man in a truck drew up
behind us and started gesturing for us to drive around.  I was hesitant, but
after a couple of French and German cars went for it the FOMO kicked in and we
drove pretty much to the front of the queue.  It turned out to be the EU lane.</p>

<p>On the Polish side our documents and car were examined and we were on our way.
Unfortunately a tourist group from Djion France heading also for Odessa were
turned back because they didn't have their car passport with them.</p>

<p>We were welcomed to Ukraine with some of the biggest pot holes known to
mankind.  After similar checking of documents and car we were allowed on our
way, into the Ukraine. The whole thing took just over three hours, but felt
relatively very quick and efficient compared to awful wait the locals had to
endure. We've been warned not to drive through Moldova as the border crossings
are apparently even worse.</p>

<p>By the time we got onto Ukrainian roads it was already getting dark and the
journey was growing a little hairy.  I took the first shift, and tried to
ignore Kai's instructions to drive as fast as the locals.  I was also concious
that we hadn't modified our right hand drive beams.</p>

<p>Kai decided that the best technique for driving on Ukrainian roads was to drive
right in the middle of the road, which meant that as the passenger, on the left
hand side, I was sat directly in the path of on coming traffic. Kai, as the
driver, had the only air bag.  We took a very interesting route around our
destination L'viv, as an awful lot of the main roads have been closed for
maintenance work, but we did eventually find our hostel. On the fourth floor of
a dark and slightly foreboding building without a lift. By this time I think we
were both rather hungry and feeling rather stressed.</p>

<p>Between us Kai and I managed to avoid an owl and a pussy cat (it lost several
lives). Really.</p>

<p>We did bump into another team <a href="https://mongolrally11.theadventurists.com/index.php?mode=teamwebsites&amp;name=immaculate-pasta">Immaculate
Pasta</a>
featuing Donald, Dougle and Jordan. They had zig-zagged up from Budapest and
heading for Kviv, then down to Odessa and Iran. Nice.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/5985025447/" title="Our Ukrainian Campsite by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6122/5985025447_2736e398ff.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="Our Ukrainian Campsite"></a></p>

<p>For the first few days of our trip I think I was suffering from what I am
calling car-ture shock. Or maybe Kai-ture shock <img src="../../../smileys/smile4.png" alt=";)" /> But it seemed to lift
yesterday and we had a really good day.</p>

<p>I really started to enjoy driving in the Ukraine, the roads could be a lot
worse, and the drivers are fairly polite, and swerving around pot holes is
always a fun challenge. The real problem is how quickly the roads can change,
you can be driving along a section of decent dual carriage way and it will
suddenly turn into a pot-holed track road, and then change back again after a
few km.</p>

<p>Just as Kai and I were seriously discussing "wild camping", as Ed and Matt had
called it, we saw a sign for a campsite and turned off. We turned out to be the
only campers, but there were a few families and children  relaxing by the bar
and lake. I was starving, and the very friendly and accommodating staff opened
the kitchen for us and made us some soupy broth and fried fish ribs. And then
came the main course of sausage and fried potatoes. Jumping into the water was
fantastic.</p>

<p>We got back on the road fairly early this morning to more beautiful weather and
scenery.  And then, out of the blue so to speak, we got stopped by the police.
We quite quickly understood that we had been speeding at 80kph (50mph) in a
50kph (30mph) zone. We weren't quite sure what they wanted to do about it
though, we tried to point out that someone had actually overtaken us as we'd
been pulled over. Kai was driving and got called out of the car, and oddly went
and sat in a police car. Negotiation started at 100 Euros. By the time Kai came
back to the car it was down to 50 and Kai was suggesting 30. I went over with
30 Euros in our phrase book to take my turn. The inside door handle didn't
work, which made me feel a bit trapped, but the young policeman told me to open
it again from the outside. As he leafed through our phrase book I worried that
the money would fall out prematurely, but amazingly it stayed put. We then
resumed negotiations. We wrote "40" on his hand, I wrote "30" on his hand and
he agreed. I handed over the money and kicked myself for not writing "20".</p>

<p>Not an hour later we were stopped again. I definitely wasn't speeding this time
as I'd just turned out of a junction. Which turned out to be the problem, they
actually had a video of me overtaking a truck as I left the junction. Now the
truck had actually stopped, I thought, to allow me to overtake, which I did,
there being nothing else on the road. I think the police were saying that I
should have actually stopped at the junction, I assume there could be a stop
sign that was hidden but the massive great fuck off lorry that I overtook. This
time they asked for 400 UAH, and they accepted 200 after surprisingly finding a
<a href="https://www.e-keepkool.fr/">French Mongol Rally team</a> who were just about to pull away. They were fined for
crossing the dubious white line in the middle of the road, Which the French
rallier said he did not do. Confusingly the Police man also said the speed
limit is 90km/h, so I don't know how the hell they could find us an hour
earlier doing 80km/h.</p>

<p>I have to say, the police have been pretty pleasant, not intimidating at all,
though they are crooks. The price of freedom seems to be ~20EUR a pop here.</p>
