<p>Following on from the previous <a href="../../../posts/Russia_to_Azerbaijan/">Russia to Azerbaijan</a> post, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=301264206907&amp;topic=37245">Rob
Mills</a> explains
that the Azerbaijan border isn't the problem, it's the Russians who don't let
non-CIS (ex-soviet) citizens through. I have written to the Russian Embassy in
London and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/40774134132641792">tweeted</a>,
and they have yet to reply. Drat.</p>

<p>Oh well, that saves on the costly double entry visa for Russia and one for
Azerbaijan.</p>

<p>In other news, Jamie and I have convinced his parents that we will keep the car
in Steyning, West Sussex once we've bought it. We have been looking for 1L cars
on <a href="https://www.autotrader.co.uk">Autotrader</a> and there aren't that many
choices. I'm keen on a Polo or a Toyota Yaris, though there doesn't seem to be
a lot of choice, especially when you only consider Private Ads and &lt;10 years
<a href="https://mongolrally.theadventurists.com/index.php?mode=handbook&amp;handbook=mongolrallypublic&amp;page=publicvehiclerules">Mongol Rally car
rule</a>.
Our budget is 1500GBP btw.</p>

<p>I am quite excited to have met a person from Kyrgyzstan who is doing a English
class in the building I live in near Edgware Road. I also heard that Turkmen
school here, so I am trying to work out a way of announcing my "mission" to a
class of English learners. I am hoping to get hosted / guided whilst we pass
through these exotic stans.</p>

<p>We've setup a charity <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/geekout">donation</a> page that
should make it easy for you all to donate money, not to us, though to
<a href="https://www.cncf.org">Mongolian kids who have had it rough</a>. Our target is
1000GBP, please give something.  Anything. Crikey. I am not going to spend it!</p>

<p>Well a "Good day to you Sirs! Isn't it a little crowded around here in London?"

<p>I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8f1qf2Gcpg">saw your car</a>. It doesn't look

<p>Jamie and I aren't intrepid buddies from 6th form in a gap year!</p>

<p>No, no we are seasoned travellers. Jamie has been <a href="https://map.kitten-x.com/">several
places</a> and so have I on <a href="https://maps.natalian.org/">the world
map</a>.</p>

<p>We express cultural sensitivies and this is why instead of robbing and
pillaging people along our <a href="../../../route/">route</a> to Mongolia, we are <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/geekout">raising
money</a> for those <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/razorbern/sets/72157624626516580/with/4923602887/">poor
people</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore did you know we are donating our car once we arrive? Mongolians
will have less need to cruelly sadle up an animal and parade on its back.</p>

<p>How are you saving the world?</p>

<p>As you may or may not know, Kai and I are planning to do the Mongol
Rally this July. It's a jaunt in the name of charity, but as it's
something that I want to do I feel bad asking friends and family to
sponsor me do it. So we've come up with something a mite more fun.*</p>

<p>Here's the deal: for every donation that you make you can enter
one of our two sweepstakes in which you must guess how far we
will travel or how long it will take us. The clock and odometer stop
when we either reach the finish line in Ulaanbaatar or fail completely.
Our readings are final. Please be as specific as possible, eg, include
minutes/metres. Duplicate entries will be disregarded. The prize will
be 10% of the value of donations up to a maximum of £50 for each
of the two sweepstakes. We'll also see if we can find some exciting
artefacts (or tacky souvenirs) to bring back for the winners. All
donations will go to charity and the winnings will come out of our
own pockets (hence the £50 limit). Clear? Good.</p>

<p>To give you a better chance at estimating: we will be starting at
Goodwood, West Sussex at approximately 4pm on Saturday 23 July. We
will be travelling in a car that is no older than 10 years and has an
engine of less than 1.3 litres, something like a Nissan Micra or VW
Polo, possibly a Toyota Rav4 or one of those little Suzukis (if you
have a spare one of these or similar hanging around, let us know).
There's just one Czech point (haha) which we leave (I think) on 25 July
and then the route is up to us. We plan to go south of the Caspian
and Black seas, ie, via Turkey and Iran. We also plan to stop off in
Odessa.</p>

<p>Using straight lines this is 6,273 miles. Using Google directions it's
6,723 miles to Korday, Kazakhstan where it stops giving directions.
When making our visa application we estimated that it would take us 5
weeks. Last year roughly 2/3 of cars made it to the finish line. Feel
free to do more research on the Rally:</p>

<p><a href="https://mongolrally.theadventurists.com/">https://mongolrally.theadventurists.com/</a></p>

<p>How to enter:</p>

<p>There is a Just Giving page for each of the two sweepstakes. Donate
your money and leave an appropriate guess in your comment. I'm
afraid we will not be able to correct mistakes, but hey, you can try again.</p>

<p>If you want to guess at the duration of our journey go to:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/geekoutTime">https://www.justgiving.com/geekoutTime</a></p>

<p>If you want to guess at the final distance of our journey go to:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/geekoutDistance">https://www.justgiving.com/geekoutDistance</a></p>

<p>We have yet to decide when we will stop accepting entries.</p>

<p>If you want to donate but not take part there are also two pages for
straight donations:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/GeekoutAmnesty">https://www.justgiving.com/GeekoutAmnesty</a>
<a href="https://www.justgiving.com/geekout">https://www.justgiving.com/geekout</a></p>

<p>Donate on either of those pages and you can request slogans to be
written on our car, guess when/where Kai and I will have our first
argument or who will kill who first and how.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Jamie</p>

<p>&ast; Fun is not guaranteed.</p>
