<p>The drive to Astana was very long but fairly uneventful. If you have a look at
<a href="https://geekout.org.uk/map/">the map</a> you can see we drove around a very large lake in the south of the
country, which was an absolutely <a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=45.759859,76.168213&amp;spn=4.522295,9.854736&amp;t=h&amp;z=7&amp;vpsrc=6">beautiful perfect turquoise colour</a>, not unlike
the Kazakh flag, maybe that's where it comes from.</p>

<p>Darkness fell between 7 and 8 when we still had a considerable distance to go.
By that point we'd driven for about 12 hours and covered about 3/4 of the
1100km (passing our 10,000th mile on the way). Passing through Karagandy there
were a couple of signed detours along surprisingly bad roads, considering that
we were travelling from Kazakhstan's biggest city to its capital. At one point
I was following a couple of cars along a flyover when they drove around a small
road block. I followed, not thinking much of it. Then we came to another road
block and both cars turned off the road. I followed. The road got smaller and
smaller until it was barely a dusty track. We crossed several railway tracks.
Kai started to freak out. Just as I was beginning to wonder if we should turn
around we found tarmac again, and eventually met the main road again.</p>

<p>Incredible. Relief.</p>

<p>Reaching Astana at midnight we managed to find a hotel very quickly, and went
straight to bed. We'd been driving for 16 hours.</p>

<p>The stories of Astana we'd heard in Almaty led me to imagine something along
the lines of Ashgabat, lots of new but empty and useless/already fading
buildings. But actually it was pretty normal as things go. Kai and I went to
see the Norman Foster "tent" this morning. It looked disappointedly small from
the outside, but it does manage to contain a six story shopping mall. As a
measure of how bright it is here, I took a picture <em>inside</em> the shopping mall
at ISO 100.</p>

<p>We're now rushin' to Russia. We'll probably camp tonight, hopefully inside
Russia, and make Novosibirsk tomorrow.</p>

<p>I was fearing the border crossing to Kazakhstan from Kyrgyzstan, just north of
Bishkek and most of my fears came true*. I would like to call it the worst
border crossing I've been to, though all in all, despite some confusion, we
crossed in probably 2 hours, which is pretty remarkable. Still the fact that
people in camouflaged balaclavas are milling around the Kazakh side armed to
the teeth was a bit unnerving to say the least.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6087836815/" title="Meet Up by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6203/6087836815_038626ede8.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="Meet Up"></a></p>

<p>We filled up without issue and on we went to Almaty [Pronounced Al-Murray]. We
then spotted a Mongol Rally ambulance in a scenic lay-by (above). We
stopped, chatted and with the 3 girls and 2 boys of that team [They hadn't seem
to have decided on a name] and they kindly made us some Earl Grey tea.  Yes,
they were English too. They had been in Kazakhstan for 3 days already, and were
taking it slow.</p>

<p>We made it to Almaty, a place I actually visited 7 years ago, to be met with my
old Russian Kazakh friend Ivan. I incorrectly remembered Almaty as being quite
small and initially I felt confident I would find the centre. Second time
around Almaty seems to have changed dramatically. Many more cars and buildings.</p>

<p>Ivan did find me and on we went together with the 3 Icelanders to find an
apartment. The first lady swiftly excused herself from offering a flat after
seeing us... 3 of us had long beards, all of us had tans, shorts and looked
pretty ragged.</p>

<p>Eventually Jamie and I stayed at Ivan's and we found a place for the 3
Icelanders really close to city centre. Not without incident, since we had
dinner before where we all had a glass of beer. Ivan then said, in no uncertain
terms that we could not possibly drive, since Kazakhstan is zero tolerant on
alcohol (which we didn't know, apparently enforced by police using just their
noses).  We tried to go out though a couple of us still had diarrhoea and the
bar we initially went to had a private function. At 1am we were all glad to get
some sleep. What a long day...</p>

<p>Speaking with Ivan the next day, he seemed incredulous that we have driven all
this way. Through Kyrgyzstan which he regards as being very unsafe, and then
onto Russia which is 3 days solid drive away. He also informed us there is a
petrol crises in Kazakhstan, making it hard to find fuel. Not again I
thought... most of central Asia and even Iran can have long queues for petrol.
It was particularly bad in Uzbekistan. Though we have avoided most issues so
far, I guess mainly due to friendly locals sharing private stock.</p>

<p>The days we spent recovering and catching up on the few days we were off the
Internet. The Icelanders left for Astana yesterday (Sunday 28th), though I was
too ill to leave. Also Ivan's mother was very kindly cleaning our laundry.</p>

<p>It's Monday morning now and we've packed up after enjoying a couple of poached
eggs for breakfast. It's time for the 16-20hr drive north to Astana.</p>

<p>* False. Kai told me that the Kazakh border would be the most corrupt and
dodgy border that we would encounter. I was asked for $10 in order to re-enter
the border after accidentally leaving it, but I didn't pay and we didn't lose
any money or possessions, unlike many other borders that we have crossed so
far.</p>

<p>We just made the Kazakhstan/Russia border by night fall. It was a little windy
and some of the coldest weather we've experienced since Europe. The Kazakh
guards were all very friendly, and unusually thorough.  Our car got its first
semi-decent search, they got us to take everything out of the boot and even had
a look at the spare, though not really checking the rest of the car. As ever
they asked beforehand if we were carrying any heroin. We proceeded to passport
control where my two passports were given even more attention than normal.
Slowly more and more senior officials were called, until a small huddle formed,
all looking at my passports in puzzled silence, as if they were trying to crack
a particularly hard maths problem or crossword clue. The trouble is, once
they've decided there's a problem they can't really just let you through
without loosing face, you have to come up with some new piece of evidence for
them to go "Aaaah, that's ok then." Eventually I pointed out, for the second
time, that upon entering the country I'd had both my visa (in my old passport)
stamped <em>and</em> my new passport stamped, and we were on our way.</p>

<p>Russia is a serious country and I was expecting a serious border, but it was
actually one of the easiest entries we've had. <em>The</em> easiest I would say, very
quick and straight forward.</p>

<p>By this time it was 9pm and very dark. We'd always planned to camp the other
side of the border as Novosibirsk was quite a drive away, and we'd had to leave
Kazakhstan as you have to register after five days and we were on our fifth
day. So we drove a little way into Russia, turned into a side road, drove
enough of a distance to be hidden from the road (so we thought) setup camp and
had noodles with egg for dinner. Again.</p>

<p>We were awoken by the sound of a vehicle. It was definitely coming towards us.
I knew it was going to stop at our tent. It stopped at our tent. There was a
shout. Probably in Russian. I reluctantly unzipped the door. There were three
Russian soldiers with guns standing around their Lada 4x4. Kai got up and I
started to pack away our things. We didn't share much in the way of language,
but once they'd seen our passports they left. We weren't sure if they wanted us
to leave or not, but three guys with guns worked pretty well as an alarm clock
and it was past 7am so we decided to leave, without even the cup of tea we'd
offered the soldiers.</p>
