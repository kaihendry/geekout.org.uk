	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/5941280518/&quot; title=&quot;Shadows by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6140/5941280518_bb7d5521d5_t.jpg&quot; width=&quot;66&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;Shadows&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Forgot to mention in &lt;a href=&quot;https://geekout.org.uk/posts/One_Week_and_Counting/&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt; that both my ex-flatmates are doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://mongolia.charityrallies.org/&quot;&gt;the other Mongol Rally&lt;/a&gt; which is supposed to be more charity and consists of teams driving ambulances all on the same fairly direct route through Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. They contacted me on Thursday asking about Turkey as they were &lt;a href=&quot;https://mongoliarally.tumblr.com/post/7647289663/access-denied&quot;&gt;stuck at the Ukraine border&lt;/a&gt;. They&#39;re now going north through Lithuania and Latvia on a bit of a detour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also forgot to mention that Kai&#39;s also got himself a special T-shirt too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I managed to remove Josh&#39;s cleverly bolted on sump guard to change the oil and oil filter. Several people had suggested doing it and when I checked the Haynes Manual it said to change the oil and filter every 4,500 miles. Meaning that even now we should really be looking to change it en route too.&lt;/p&gt;
