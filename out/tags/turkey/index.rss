	<description>&lt;p&gt;Quick update from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6021067536&quot;&gt;Hotel Grand
Derya&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/100221396923322368&quot;&gt;Dogbiscuit,
Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve done over 4k miles now! We covered some distance from Istanbul, Cappadocia, all
the way here to this Iranian border town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6018436619/&quot; title=&quot;Ballooning @ Cappadocia by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6023/6018436619_de6f6988c2_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;424&quot; alt=&quot;Ballooning @ Cappadocia&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cappadocia, although a tourist trap, was actually pretty good. Through the power
of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/TurkeyTourismUK/status/99108049226186755&quot;&gt;twitter
network&lt;/a&gt;, we
probably had the best hotel in Cappadocia at a good price. It had a pool, the
host Hassan arranged a balloon flight the next morning. Fantastic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6018997382/&quot; title=&quot;Kaymaklı Underground City by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6008/6018997382_937b50116d_t.jpg&quot; width=&quot;66&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;Kaymaklı Underground City&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6018998542/&quot; title=&quot;Cappadocia by Jamie Kitson, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6020/6018998542_8684e9ddec_t.jpg&quot; width=&quot;66&quot; height=&quot;100&quot; alt=&quot;Cappadocia&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Next after checking cave after cave (btw, I hate caves now) [they were not caves, but hollowed out rock. First the massive &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaymakl%C4%B1_Underground_City&quot;&gt;underground city&lt;/a&gt; and then the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_of_G%C3%B6reme,_Turkey&quot;&gt;Göreme Open Air Museum&lt;/a&gt; - Jamie], we drove till dusk
and &quot;wild camped&quot; in a nice spot. The Turkish countryside has been stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are quickly going to check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishak_Pasha_Palace&quot;&gt;Ishak Pasha
Palace&lt;/a&gt; and then try the
Iranian border. Hopefully we&#39;ll be over by lunch and then get a 4-5hr drive to
Tabriz to check out another &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1346&quot;&gt;UNESCO site&lt;/a&gt;
on the way to Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &quot;Interneting&quot;, i.e. our internet connectivity, twitter updates, blogs and
video uploads might come to a crashing halt. However we do have a SPOT messenger,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0E4XTjiADylnLZeEL5e24gU0yUzxckg9Q&quot;&gt;with map
updates&lt;/a&gt;
however it is limited to only 41 characters. So if you wondering why &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kaihendry&quot;&gt;my
tweets&lt;/a&gt; are so short in Iran. That&#39;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;349&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0sJxuT2txQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria was surprisingly OK. For me it&#39;s a strange mix of Russian (they
understand it, unlike the Romanians seemingly) and France (cute rustic
buildings and amazing countryside). Food is pretty bad and I&#39;m totally
unconvinced on Bulgarian&#39;s sense of taste and style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varna and resorts to the south seemed popular for the English tourists and to
be honest the prices and women are quite attractive. Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we quickly did the UNESCO tourist trap of Nessebar and headed into Turkey.
Border crossing was great... friendly staff and an initial hiccup with their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/98788319923666944&quot;&gt;computer failing&lt;/a&gt;.
What a super drive. The scenery was stunning and dropping into Turkey was like
entering another world. Fantastic scenery.  Awesome sunset. Incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish roads and infrastructure seem amazingly good. We were a little worried
we forgot the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignette_(road_tax)&quot;&gt;Vignette&lt;/a&gt;, though we
picked up a KSG Auto-bahn card at a petrol station. We were easily averaging
100km/h and we made it into Istanbul with the help of Google maps... without
incident. Nuts. [Good driving, huh? - Jamie]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 50EUR per night twin room hostel in Istanbul&#39;s Sultanahmet is a bit poor
value for money to say the least.  There seems to be a chasm between &quot;hostel&quot;
and &quot;hotel&quot; and it&#39;s really hard to bridge it. I am not interested really in
talking with tourists from UK and the West [unless they&#39;re good looking]. I&#39;m
more keen to chat with locals.  A decent wifi Internet connection would be nice
too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiekitson/6008557642/&quot; title=&quot;In Istanbul, not Constantinople&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm7.static.flickr.com/6004/6008557642_9a60a54644_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;424&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the weather is pretty hot, though I&#39;ve got the Blue Mosque, the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/hendry/6007851939/&quot;&gt;bath&lt;/a&gt; and the Sofia Mosque
out the way and I&#39;m feeling pretty weak and dazed. There is a lot of history
here which makes me feel a little depressed tbh. Life is incredibly short in
the scheme of things and I worry a bit how I fit in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frustratingly Google Maps does not work (very strange) and we don&#39;t have a map
of Iran*. Can&#39;t help but feel our lack of planning ahead is catching up with us.
And finding information with a shit internet connection in Istanbul is crazy
hard compared to London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Must thank Ruth who I contacted to help find some accommodation in Turkey for
us. I did another &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/kaihendry/status/99104332758265857&quot;&gt;shout
out&lt;/a&gt; for help
tomorrow, wonder if anyone gets it (Folks did!!
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/TurkeyTourismUK/status/99108049226186755&quot;&gt;Thank&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/ED8617/status/99145705771376640&quot;&gt;you&lt;/a&gt; ). I guess we
should just chance it, but it could easily cost us a lot of time. I&#39;m keen to
spend 2-3 days in Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had the epiphany that Istanbul is well... the centre of the world. They
way it bridges continents and the understated Black and Aegean sea. It&#39;s just
insanely strategic. I want Turkey in the EU. &lt;img src=&quot;https://geekout.org.uk/smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Jamie: After going to multiple bookshops and drawing a complete blank on
Iranian maps I was advised by a tourist agency to try the Iranian Consulate. I
pictured an office block, but arriving I found a gated community. Nervous I
asked the Turkish policeman on guard whether it was alright to bother them, he
said yes and upon entering I found a small man, who understood enough English
to give me a map of attractions. It doesn&#39;t have any roads on it but it&#39;s
better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
